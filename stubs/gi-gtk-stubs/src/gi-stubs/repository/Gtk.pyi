class AboutDialog(Window):
    """
    Displays information about a program.

    The shown information includes the programs' logo, name, copyright,
    website and license. It is also possible to give credits to the authors,
    documenters, translators and artists who have worked on the program.

    An about dialog is typically opened when the user selects the `About`
    option from the `Help` menu. All parts of the dialog are optional.

    <picture>
      <source srcset="aboutdialot-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An example GtkAboutDialog" src="aboutdialog.png">
    </picture>

    About dialogs often contain links and email addresses. `GtkAboutDialog`
    displays these as clickable links. By default, it calls [method@Gtk.FileLauncher.launch]
    when a user clicks one. The behaviour can be overridden with the
    [signal@Gtk.AboutDialog::activate-link] signal.

    To specify a person with an email address, use a string like
    `Edgar Allan Poe <edgar@poe.com>`. To specify a website with a title,
    use a string like `GTK team https://www.gtk.org`.

    To make constructing an about dialog as convenient as possible, you can
    use the function [func@Gtk.show_about_dialog] which constructs and shows
    a dialog and keeps it around so that it can be shown again.

    Note that GTK sets a default title of `_("About %s")` on the dialog
    window (where `%s` is replaced by the name of the application, but in
    order to ensure proper translation of the title, applications should
    set the title property explicitly when constructing an about dialog,
    as shown in the following example:

    ```c
    GFile *logo_file = g_file_new_for_path ("./logo.png");
    GdkTexture *example_logo = gdk_texture_new_from_file (logo_file, NULL);
    g_object_unref (logo_file);

    gtk_show_about_dialog (NULL,
                           "program-name", "ExampleCode",
                           "logo", example_logo,
                           "title", _("About ExampleCode"),
                           NULL);
    ```

    ## Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkAboutDialog` supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - <kbd>Escape</kbd> closes the window.

    ## CSS nodes

    `GtkAboutDialog` has a single CSS node with the name `window` and style
    class `.aboutdialog`.

class Accessible(GObject.GInterface):
    """
    An interface for describing UI elements for Assistive Technologies.

    Every accessible implementation has:

     - a “role”, represented by a value of the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole] enumeration
     - “attributes”, represented by a set of [enum@Gtk.AccessibleState],
       [enum@Gtk.AccessibleProperty] and [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRelation] values

    The role cannot be changed after instantiating a `GtkAccessible`
    implementation.

    The attributes are updated every time a UI element's state changes in
    a way that should be reflected by assistive technologies. For instance,
    if a `GtkWidget` visibility changes, the %GTK_ACCESSIBLE_STATE_HIDDEN
    state will also change to reflect the [property@Gtk.Widget:visible] property.

    Every accessible implementation is part of a tree of accessible objects.
    Normally, this tree corresponds to the widget tree, but can be customized
    by reimplementing the [vfunc@Gtk.Accessible.get_accessible_parent],
    [vfunc@Gtk.Accessible.get_first_accessible_child] and
    [vfunc@Gtk.Accessible.get_next_accessible_sibling] virtual functions.

    Note that you can not create a top-level accessible object as of now,
    which means that you must always have a parent accessible object.

    Also note that when an accessible object does not correspond to a widget,
    and it has children, whose implementation you don't control,
    it is necessary to ensure the correct shape of the a11y tree
    by calling [method@Gtk.Accessible.set_accessible_parent] and
    updating the sibling by [method@Gtk.Accessible.update_next_accessible_sibling].

    `GtkActionBar` is expected to be displayed below the content and expand
    horizontally to fill the area.

    It allows placing children at the start or the end. In addition, it
    contains an internal centered box which is centered with respect to
    the full width of the box, even if the children at either side take
    up different amounts of space.

    # GtkActionBar as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkActionBar` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface supports
    adding children at the start or end sides by specifying “start” or “end” as
    the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element, or setting the center widget
    by specifying “center” value.

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    actionbar
    ╰── revealer
        ╰── box
            ├── box.start
            │   ╰── [start children]
            ├── [center widget]
            ╰── box.end
                ╰── [end children]
    ```

    A `GtkActionBar`'s CSS node is called `actionbar`. It contains a `revealer`
    subnode, which contains a `box` subnode, which contains two `box` subnodes at
    the start and end of the action bar, with `start` and `end` style classes
    respectively, as well as a center node that represents the center child.

    Each of the boxes contains children packed for that side.

class Application(GObject.Object):
    """
    A high-level API for writing applications.

    `GtkApplication` supports many aspects of writing a GTK application
    in a convenient fashion, without enforcing a one-size-fits-all model.

    Currently, it handles GTK initialization, application uniqueness, session
    management, provides some basic scriptability and desktop shell integration
    by exporting actions and menus and manages a list of toplevel windows whose
    life-cycle is automatically tied to the life-cycle of your application.

    While `GtkApplication` works fine with plain [class@Gtk.Window]s,
    it is recommended to use it together with [class@Gtk.ApplicationWindow].

    ## Automatic resources

    `GtkApplication` will automatically load menus from the `GtkBuilder`
    resource located at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's
    resource base path (see [method@Gio.Application.set_resource_base_path]).
    The menu with the ID "menubar" is taken as the application's
    menubar. Additional menus (most interesting submenus) can be named
    and accessed via [method@Gtk.Application.get_menu_by_id] which allows for
    dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.

    Note that automatic resource loading uses the resource base path
    that is set at construction time and will not work if the resource
    base path is changed at a later time.

    It is also possible to provide the menubar manually using
    [method@Gtk.Application.set_menubar].

    `GtkApplication` will also automatically setup an icon search path for
    the default icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base
    path. This allows your application to easily store its icons as
    resources. See [method@Gtk.IconTheme.add_resource_path] for more
    information.

    If there is a resource located at `gtk/help-overlay.ui` which
    defines a [class@Gtk.ShortcutsWindow] with ID `help_overlay` then
    `GtkApplication` associates an instance of this shortcuts window with
    each [class@Gtk.ApplicationWindow] and sets up the keyboard accelerator
    <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> to open it. To create a menu item that
    displays the shortcuts window, associate the item with the action
    `win.show-help-overlay`.

    `GtkApplication` will also automatically set the application id as the
    default window icon. Use [func@Gtk.Window.set_default_icon_name] or
    [property@Gtk.Window:icon-name] to override that behavior.

    ## A simple application

    [A simple example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/main/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)
    is available in the GTK source code repository

    `GtkApplication` optionally registers with a session manager of the
    users session (if you set the [property@Gtk.Application:register-session]
    property) and offers various functionality related to the session
    life-cycle.

    An application can block various ways to end the session with
    the [method@Gtk.Application.inhibit] function. Typical use cases for
    this kind of inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations,
    such as burning a CD or performing a disk backup. The session
    manager may not honor the inhibitor, but it can be expected to
    inform the user about the negative consequences of ending the
    session while inhibitors are present.

class ApplicationWindow(Window):
    """
    A `GtkWindow` subclass that integrates with `GtkApplication`.

    Notably, `GtkApplicationWindow` can handle an application menubar.

    This class implements the [iface@Gio.ActionGroup] and [iface@Gio.ActionMap]
    interfaces, to let you add window-specific actions that will be exported
    by the associated [class@Gtk.Application], together with its application-wide
    actions. Window-specific actions are prefixed with the “win.”
    prefix and application-wide actions are prefixed with the “app.”
    prefix. Actions must be addressed with the prefixed name when
    referring to them from a menu model.

    Note that widgets that are placed inside a `GtkApplicationWindow`
    can also activate these actions, if they implement the
    [iface@Gtk.Actionable] interface.

    The settings [property@Gtk.Settings:gtk-shell-shows-app-menu] and
    [property@Gtk.Settings:gtk-shell-shows-menubar] tell GTK whether the
    desktop environment is showing the application menu and menubar
    models outside the application as part of the desktop shell.
    For instance, on OS X, both menus will be displayed remotely;
    on Windows neither will be.

    If the desktop environment does not display the menubar, it can be shown in
    the `GtkApplicationWindow` by setting the
    [property@Gtk.ApplicationWindow:show-menubar] property to true. If the
    desktop environment does not display the application menu, then it will
    automatically be included in the menubar or in the window’s client-side
    decorations.

    See [class@Gtk.PopoverMenu] for information about the XML language
    used by `GtkBuilder` for menu models.

    See also: [method@Gtk.Application.set_menubar].

    Reads XML descriptions of a user interface and instantiates the described objects.

    To create a `GtkBuilder` from a user interface description, call
    [ctor@Gtk.Builder.new_from_file], [ctor@Gtk.Builder.new_from_resource]
    or [ctor@Gtk.Builder.new_from_string].

    In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface
    descriptions from multiple sources to the same `GtkBuilder` you can
    call [ctor@Gtk.Builder.new] to get an empty builder and populate it by
    (multiple) calls to [method@Gtk.Builder.add_from_file],
    [method@Gtk.Builder.add_from_resource] or
    [method@Gtk.Builder.add_from_string].

    A `GtkBuilder` holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
    and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
    cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
    contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
    builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call
    [method@Gtk.Window.destroy] to get rid of them and all the widgets
    they contain.

    The functions [method@Gtk.Builder.get_object] and
    [method@Gtk.Builder.get_objects] can be used to access the widgets in
    the interface by the names assigned to them inside the UI description.
    Toplevel windows returned by these functions will stay around until the
    user explicitly destroys them with [method@Gtk.Window.destroy]. Other
    widgets will either be part of a larger hierarchy constructed by the
    builder (in which case you should not have to worry about their lifecycle),
    or without a parent, in which case they have to be added to some container
    to make use of them. Non-widget objects need to be reffed with
    g_object_ref() to keep them beyond the lifespan of the builder.

    ## GtkBuilder UI Definitions

    `GtkBuilder` parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
    specified in XML format. We refer to these descriptions as “GtkBuilder
    UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.

    ### Structure of UI definitions

    UI definition files are always encoded in UTF-8.

    The toplevel element is `<interface>`. It optionally takes a “domain”
    attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
    using `dgettext()` in the domain specified. This can also be done by
    calling [method@Gtk.Builder.set_translation_domain] on the builder.
    For example:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <interface domain="your-app">
      ...
    </interface>
    ```

    ### Requirements

    The target toolkit version(s) are described by `<requires>` elements,
    the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
    the only supported value is “gtk”) and the “version” attribute specifies
    the target version in the form “`<major>`.`<minor>`”. `GtkBuilder` will
    error out if the version requirements are not met. For example:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <interface domain="your-app">
      <requires lib="gtk" version="4.0" />
    </interface>
    ```

    ### Objects

    Objects are defined as children of the `<interface>` element.

    Objects are described by `<object>` elements, which can contain
    `<property>` elements to set properties, `<signal>` elements which
    connect signals to handlers, and `<child>` elements, which describe
    child objects.

    Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an `<object>`
    element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
    been loaded yet, GTK tries to find the `get_type()` function from the
    class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
    necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the `get_type()`
    function explicitly with the "type-func" attribute. If your UI definition
    is referencing internal types, you should make sure to call
    `g_type_ensure()` for each object type before parsing the UI definition.

    Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
    application to retrieve them from the builder with
    [method@Gtk.Builder.get_object]. An id is also necessary to use the
    object as property value in other parts of the UI definition. GTK
    reserves ids starting and ending with `___` (three consecutive
    underscores) for its own purposes.

    ### Properties

    Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
    `<property>` element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
    property, and the content of the element specifies the value:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkButton">
      <property name="label">Hello, world</property>
    </object>
    ```

    If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK uses
    `gettext()` (or `dgettext()` if the builder has a translation domain set)
    to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
    is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
    probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
    specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
    may help the translators:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkButton">
      <property name="label"
                translatable="yes"
                context="button"
                comments="A classic">Hello, world</property>
    </object>
    ```

    The xgettext tool that is part of gettext can extract these strings,
    but note that it only looks for translatable="yes".

    `GtkBuilder` can parse textual representations for the most common
    property types:

    - characters
    - strings
    - integers
    - floating-point numbers
    - booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
      as true values, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
      as false values)
    - string lists (separated by newlines)
    - enumeration types (can be specified by their full C identifier their short
      name used when registering the enumeration type, or their integer value)
    - flag types (can be specified by their C identifier or short name,
      optionally combined with “|” for bitwise OR, or a single integer value
      e.g., “GTK_INPUT_HINT_EMOJI|GTK_INPUT_HINT_LOWERCASE”, or “emoji|lowercase” or 520).
    - colors (in the format understood by [method@Gdk.RGBA.parse])
    - transforms (in the format understood by [func@Gsk.Transform.parse])
    - Pango attribute lists (in the format understood by [method@Pango.AttrList.to_string])
    - Pango tab arrays (in the format understood by [method@Pango.TabArray.to_string])
    - Pango font descriptions (in the format understood by [func@Pango.FontDescription.from_string])
    - `GVariant` (in the format understood by [func@GLib.Variant.parse])
    - textures (can be specified as an object id, a resource path or a filename of an image file to load relative to the Builder file or the CWD if [method@Gtk.Builder.add_from_string] was used)
    - GFile (like textures, can be specified as an object id, a URI or a filename of a file to load relative to the Builder file or the CWD if [method@Gtk.Builder.add_from_string] was used)

    Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to
    objects declared in the local XML fragment and objects exposed via
    [method@Gtk.Builder.expose_object]. In general, `GtkBuilder` allows
    forward references to objects declared in the local XML; an object
    doesn’t have to be constructed before it can be referred to. The
    exception to this rule is that an object has to be constructed before
    it can be used as the value of a construct-only property.

    ### Child objects

    Many widgets have properties for child widgets, such as
    [property@Gtk.Expander:child]. In this case, the preferred way to
    specify the child widget in a ui file is to simply set the property:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkExpander">
      <property name="child">
        <object class="GtkLabel">
        ...
        </object>
      </property>
    </object>
    ```

    Generic containers that can contain an arbitrary number of children,
    such as [class@Gtk.Box] instead use the `<child>` element. A `<child>`
    element contains an `<object>` element which describes the child object.
    Most often, child objects are widgets inside a container, but they can
    also be, e.g., actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model.

    Any object type that implements the [iface@Gtk.Buildable] interface can
    specify how children may be added to it. Since many objects and widgets that
    are included with GTK already implement the `GtkBuildable` interface,
    typically child objects can be added using the `<child>` element without
    having to be concerned about the underlying implementation.

    See the [`GtkWidget` documentation](class.Widget.html#gtkwidget-as-gtkbuildable)
    for many examples of using `GtkBuilder` with widgets, including setting
    child objects using the `<child>` element.

    A noteworthy special case to the general rule that only objects implementing
    `GtkBuildable` may specify how to handle the `<child>` element is that
    `GtkBuilder` provides special support for adding objects to a
    [class@Gio.ListStore] by using the `<child>` element. For instance:

    ```xml
    <object class="GListStore">
      <property name="item-type">MyObject</property>
      <child>
        <object class="MyObject" />
      </child>
      ...
    </object>
    ```

    ### Property bindings

    It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
    property value using the attributes "bind-source" to specify the
    source object of the binding, and optionally, "bind-property" and
    "bind-flags" to specify the source property and source binding flags
    respectively. Internally, `GtkBuilder` implements this using
    [class@GObject.Binding] objects.

    For instance, in the example below the “label” property of the
    `bottom_label` widget is bound to the “label” property of the
    `top_button` widget:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkBox">
      <property name="orientation">vertical</property>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkButton" id="top_button">
          <property name="label">Hello, world</property>
        </object>
      </child>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkLabel" id="bottom_label">
          <property name="label"
                    bind-source="top_button"
                    bind-property="label"
                    bind-flags="sync-create" />
        </object>
      </child>
    </object>
    ```

    For more information, see the documentation of the
    [method@GObject.Object.bind_property] method.

    Please note that another way to set up bindings between objects in .ui files
    is to use the `GtkExpression` methodology. See the
    [`GtkExpression` documentation](class.Expression.html#gtkexpression-in-ui-files)
    for more information.

    ### Internal children

    Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
    been constructed by GTK as part of a composite widget, to set
    properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the content area
    of a `GtkDialog`). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
    property of the `<child>` element to a true value. Note that `GtkBuilder`
    still requires an `<object>` element for the internal child, even if it
    has already been constructed.

    ### Specialized children

    A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
    (e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
    a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a `<child>`
    The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
    sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.

    ### Signal handlers and function pointers

    Signal handlers are set up with the `<signal>` element. The “name”
    attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
    specifies the function to connect to the signal.

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkButton" id="hello_button">
      <signal name="clicked" handler="hello_button__clicked" />
    </object>
    ```

    The remaining attributes, “after”, “swapped” and “object”, have the
    same meaning as the corresponding parameters of the
    [func@GObject.signal_connect_object] or [func@GObject.signal_connect_data]
    functions:

    - “after” matches the `G_CONNECT_AFTER` flag, and will ensure that the
      handler is called after the default class closure for the signal
    - “swapped” matches the `G_CONNECT_SWAPPED` flag, and will swap the
      instance and closure arguments when invoking the signal handler
    - “object” will bind the signal handler to the lifetime of the object
      referenced by the attribute

    By default "swapped" will be set to "yes" if not specified otherwise, in
    the case where "object" is set, for convenience. A “last_modification_time”
    attribute is also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the builder.

    When compiling applications for Windows, you must declare signal callbacks
    with the `G_MODULE_EXPORT` decorator, or they will not be put in the symbol
    table:

    ```c
    G_MODULE_EXPORT void
    hello_button__clicked (GtkButton *button,
                           gpointer data)
    {
      // ...
    }
    ```

    On Linux and Unix, this is not necessary; applications should instead
    be compiled with the `-Wl,--export-dynamic` argument inside their compiler
    flags, and linked against `gmodule-export-2.0`.

    ## Example UI Definition

    ```xml
    <interface>
      <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
        <child internal-child="content_area">
          <object class="GtkBox">
            <child internal-child="action_area">
              <object class="GtkBox">
                <child>
                  <object class="GtkButton" id="ok_button">
                    <property name="label" translatable="yes">_Ok</property>
                    <property name="use-underline">True</property>
                    <signal name="clicked" handler="ok_button_clicked"/>
                  </object>
                </child>
              </object>
            </child>
          </object>
        </child>
      </object>
    </interface>
    ```

    ## Using GtkBuildable for extending UI definitions

    Objects can implement the [iface@Gtk.Buildable] interface to add custom
    elements and attributes to the XML. Typically, any extension will be
    documented in each type that implements the interface.

    ## Menus

    In addition to objects with properties that are created with `<object>` and
    `<property>` elements, `GtkBuilder` also allows to parse XML menu definitions
    as used by [class@Gio.Menu] when exporting menu models over D-Bus, and as
    described in the [class@Gtk.PopoverMenu] documentation. Menus can be defined
    as toplevel elements, or as property values for properties of type `GMenuModel`.

    ## Templates

    When describing a [class@Gtk.Widget], you can use the `<template>` tag to
    describe a UI bound to a specific widget type. GTK will automatically load
    the UI definition when instantiating the type, and bind children and
    signal handlers to instance fields and function symbols.

    For more information, see the [`GtkWidget` documentation](class.Widget.html#building-composite-widgets-from-template-xml)
    for details.

    The `GtkButton` widget can hold any valid child widget. That is, it can hold
    almost any other standard `GtkWidget`. The most commonly used child is the
    `GtkLabel`.

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    The following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.Button::activate]

    # CSS nodes

    `GtkButton` has a single CSS node with name button. The node will get the
    style classes .image-button or .text-button, if the content is just an
    image or label, respectively. It may also receive the .flat style class.
    When activating a button via the keyboard, the button will temporarily
    gain the .keyboard-activating style class.

    Other style classes that are commonly used with `GtkButton` include
    .suggested-action and .destructive-action. In special cases, buttons
    can be made round by adding the .circular style class.

    Button-like widgets like [class@Gtk.ToggleButton], [class@Gtk.MenuButton],
    [class@Gtk.VolumeButton], [class@Gtk.LockButton], [class@Gtk.ColorButton]
    or [class@Gtk.FontButton] use style classes such as .toggle, .popup, .scale,
    .lock, .color on the button node to differentiate themselves from a plain
    `GtkButton`.

class CellArea(GObject.InitiallyUnowned):
    """
    An abstract class for laying out `GtkCellRenderer`s

    The `GtkCellArea` is an abstract class for [iface@Gtk.CellLayout]
    widgets (also referred to as "layouting widgets") to interface with
    an arbitrary number of [class@Gtk.CellRenderer]s and interact with the user
    for a given [iface@Gtk.TreeModel] row.

    The cell area handles events, focus navigation, drawing and
    size requests and allocations for a given row of data.

    Usually users dont have to interact with the `GtkCellArea` directly
    unless they are implementing a cell-layouting widget themselves.

    ## Requesting area sizes

    As outlined in
    [GtkWidget’s geometry management section](class.Widget.html#height-for-width-geometry-management),
    GTK uses a height-for-width
    geometry management system to compute the sizes of widgets and user
    interfaces. `GtkCellArea` uses the same semantics to calculate the
    size of an area for an arbitrary number of `GtkTreeModel` rows.

    When requesting the size of a cell area one needs to calculate
    the size for a handful of rows, and this will be done differently by
    different layouting widgets. For instance a [class@Gtk.TreeViewColumn]
    always lines up the areas from top to bottom while a [class@Gtk.IconView]
    on the other hand might enforce that all areas received the same
    width and wrap the areas around, requesting height for more cell
    areas when allocated less width.

    It’s also important for areas to maintain some cell
    alignments with areas rendered for adjacent rows (cells can
    appear “columnized” inside an area even when the size of
    cells are different in each row). For this reason the `GtkCellArea`
    uses a [class@Gtk.CellAreaContext] object to store the alignments
    and sizes along the way (as well as the overall largest minimum
    and natural size for all the rows which have been calculated
    with the said context).

    The [class@Gtk.CellAreaContext] is an opaque object specific to the
    `GtkCellArea` which created it (see [method@Gtk.CellArea.create_context]).

    The owning cell-layouting widget can create as many contexts as
    it wishes to calculate sizes of rows which should receive the
    same size in at least one orientation (horizontally or vertically),
    However, it’s important that the same [class@Gtk.CellAreaContext] which
    was used to request the sizes for a given `GtkTreeModel` row be
    used when rendering or processing events for that row.

    In order to request the width of all the rows at the root level
    of a `GtkTreeModel` one would do the following:

    ```c
    GtkTreeIter iter;
    int minimum_width;
    int natural_width;

    valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
    while (valid)
      {
        gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
        gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_width (area, context, widget, NULL, NULL);

        valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
      }

    gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (context, &minimum_width, &natural_width);
    ```

    Note that in this example it’s not important to observe the
    returned minimum and natural width of the area for each row
    unless the cell-layouting object is actually interested in the
    widths of individual rows. The overall width is however stored
    in the accompanying `GtkCellAreaContext` object and can be consulted
    at any time.

    This can be useful since `GtkCellLayout` widgets usually have to
    support requesting and rendering rows in treemodels with an
    exceedingly large amount of rows. The `GtkCellLayout` widget in
    that case would calculate the required width of the rows in an
    idle or timeout source (see [func@GLib.timeout_add]) and when the widget
    is requested its actual width in [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure]
    it can simply consult the width accumulated so far in the
    `GtkCellAreaContext` object.

    A simple example where rows are rendered from top to bottom and
    take up the full width of the layouting widget would look like:

    ```c
    static void
    foo_get_preferred_width (GtkWidget *widget,
                             int       *minimum_size,
                             int       *natural_size)
    {
      Foo *self = FOO (widget);
      FooPrivate *priv = foo_get_instance_private (self);

      foo_ensure_at_least_one_handfull_of_rows_have_been_requested (self);

      gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (priv->context, minimum_size, natural_size);
    }
    ```

    In the above example the `Foo` widget has to make sure that some
    row sizes have been calculated (the amount of rows that `Foo` judged
    was appropriate to request space for in a single timeout iteration)
    before simply returning the amount of space required by the area via
    the `GtkCellAreaContext`.

    Requesting the height for width (or width for height) of an area is
    a similar task except in this case the `GtkCellAreaContext` does not
    store the data (actually, it does not know how much space the layouting
    widget plans to allocate it for every row. It’s up to the layouting
    widget to render each row of data with the appropriate height and
    width which was requested by the `GtkCellArea`).

    In order to request the height for width of all the rows at the
    root level of a `GtkTreeModel` one would do the following:

    ```c
    GtkTreeIter iter;
    int minimum_height;
    int natural_height;
    int full_minimum_height = 0;
    int full_natural_height = 0;

    valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
    while (valid)
      {
        gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
        gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_height_for_width (area, context, widget,
                                                      width, &minimum_height, &natural_height);

        if (width_is_for_allocation)
           cache_row_height (&iter, minimum_height, natural_height);

        full_minimum_height += minimum_height;
        full_natural_height += natural_height;

        valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
      }
    ```

    Note that in the above example we would need to cache the heights
    returned for each row so that we would know what sizes to render the
    areas for each row. However we would only want to really cache the
    heights if the request is intended for the layouting widgets real
    allocation.

    In some cases the layouting widget is requested the height for an
    arbitrary for_width, this is a special case for layouting widgets
    who need to request size for tens of thousands  of rows. For this
    case it’s only important that the layouting widget calculate
    one reasonably sized chunk of rows and return that height
    synchronously. The reasoning here is that any layouting widget is
    at least capable of synchronously calculating enough height to fill
    the screen height (or scrolled window height) in response to a single
    call to [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure]. Returning
    a perfect height for width that is larger than the screen area is
    inconsequential since after the layouting receives an allocation
    from a scrolled window it simply continues to drive the scrollbar
    values while more and more height is required for the row heights
    that are calculated in the background.

    ## Rendering Areas

    Once area sizes have been acquired at least for the rows in the
    visible area of the layouting widget they can be rendered at
    [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.snapshot] time.

    A crude example of how to render all the rows at the root level
    runs as follows:

    ```c
    GtkAllocation allocation;
    GdkRectangle cell_area = { 0, };
    GtkTreeIter iter;
    int minimum_width;
    int natural_width;

    gtk_widget_get_allocation (widget, &allocation);
    cell_area.width = allocation.width;

    valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
    while (valid)
      {
        cell_area.height = get_cached_height_for_row (&iter);

        gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
        gtk_cell_area_render (area, context, widget, cr,
                              &cell_area, &cell_area, state_flags, FALSE);

        cell_area.y += cell_area.height;

        valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
      }
    ```

    Note that the cached height in this example really depends on how
    the layouting widget works. The layouting widget might decide to
    give every row its minimum or natural height or, if the model content
    is expected to fit inside the layouting widget without scrolling, it
    would make sense to calculate the allocation for each row at
    the time the widget is allocated using [func@Gtk.distribute_natural_allocation].

    ## Handling Events and Driving Keyboard Focus

    Passing events to the area is as simple as handling events on any
    normal widget and then passing them to the [method@Gtk.CellArea.event]
    API as they come in. Usually `GtkCellArea` is only interested in
    button events, however some customized derived areas can be implemented
    who are interested in handling other events. Handling an event can
    trigger the [signal@Gtk.CellArea::focus-changed] signal to fire; as well
    as [signal@Gtk.CellArea::add-editable] in the case that an editable cell
    was clicked and needs to start editing. You can call
    [method@Gtk.CellArea.stop_editing] at any time to cancel any cell editing
    that is currently in progress.

    The `GtkCellArea` drives keyboard focus from cell to cell in a way
    similar to `GtkWidget`. For layouting widgets that support giving
    focus to cells it’s important to remember to pass `GTK_CELL_RENDERER_FOCUSED`
    to the area functions for the row that has focus and to tell the
    area to paint the focus at render time.

    Layouting widgets that accept focus on cells should implement the
    [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.focus] virtual method. The layouting widget is always
    responsible for knowing where `GtkTreeModel` rows are rendered inside
    the widget, so at [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.focus] time the layouting widget
    should use the `GtkCellArea` methods to navigate focus inside the area
    and then observe the [enum@Gtk.DirectionType] to pass the focus to adjacent
    rows and areas.

    A basic example of how the [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.focus] virtual method
    should be implemented:

    ```
    static gboolean
    foo_focus (GtkWidget       *widget,
               GtkDirectionType direction)
    {
      Foo *self = FOO (widget);
      FooPrivate *priv = foo_get_instance_private (self);
      int focus_row = priv->focus_row;
      gboolean have_focus = FALSE;

      if (!gtk_widget_has_focus (widget))
        gtk_widget_grab_focus (widget);

      valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, priv->focus_row);
      while (valid)
        {
          gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (priv->area, priv->model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);

          if (gtk_cell_area_focus (priv->area, direction))
            {
               priv->focus_row = focus_row;
               have_focus = TRUE;
               break;
            }
          else
            {
              if (direction == GTK_DIR_RIGHT ||
                  direction == GTK_DIR_LEFT)
                break;
              else if (direction == GTK_DIR_UP ||
                       direction == GTK_DIR_TAB_BACKWARD)
               {
                  if (focus_row == 0)
                    break;
                  else
                   {
                      focus_row--;
                      valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, focus_row);
                   }
                }
              else
                {
                  if (focus_row == last_row)
                    break;
                  else
                    {
                      focus_row++;
                      valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (priv->model, &iter);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return have_focus;
    }
    ```

    Note that the layouting widget is responsible for matching the
    `GtkDirectionType` values to the way it lays out its cells.

    ## Cell Properties

    The `GtkCellArea` introduces cell properties for `GtkCellRenderer`s.
    This provides some general interfaces for defining the relationship
    cell areas have with their cells. For instance in a [class@Gtk.CellAreaBox]
    a cell might “expand” and receive extra space when the area is allocated
    more than its full natural request, or a cell might be configured to “align”
    with adjacent rows which were requested and rendered with the same
    `GtkCellAreaContext`.

    Use [method@Gtk.CellAreaClass.install_cell_property] to install cell
    properties for a cell area class and [method@Gtk.CellAreaClass.find_cell_property]
    or [method@Gtk.CellAreaClass.list_cell_properties] to get information about
    existing cell properties.

    To set the value of a cell property, use [method@Gtk.CellArea.cell_set_property],
    [method@Gtk.CellArea.cell_set] or [method@Gtk.CellArea.cell_set_valist]. To obtain
    the value of a cell property, use [method@Gtk.CellArea.cell_get_property]
    [method@Gtk.CellArea.cell_get] or [method@Gtk.CellArea.cell_get_valist].

        for views rendering large data stores as a measure
        of optimization), then only the row that changed
        or was inserted needs to be (re)requested with
        gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_width().

        When the new overall size of the context requires
        that the allocated size changes (or whenever this
        allocation changes at all), the variable row
        sizes need to be re-requested for every row.

        For instance, if the rows are displayed all with
        the same width from top to bottom then a change
        in the allocated width necessitates a recalculation
        of all the displayed row heights using
        gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_height_for_width().

class CellLayout(GObject.GInterface):

    An interface for packing cells

    `GtkCellLayout` is an interface to be implemented by all objects which
    want to provide a `GtkTreeViewColumn` like API for packing cells,
    setting attributes and data funcs.

    One of the notable features provided by implementations of
    `GtkCellLayout` are attributes. Attributes let you set the properties
    in flexible ways. They can just be set to constant values like regular
    properties. But they can also be mapped to a column of the underlying
    tree model with gtk_cell_layout_set_attributes(), which means that the value
    of the attribute can change from cell to cell as they are rendered by
    the cell renderer. Finally, it is possible to specify a function with
    gtk_cell_layout_set_cell_data_func() that is called to determine the
    value of the attribute for each cell that is rendered.

    ## GtkCellLayouts as GtkBuildable

    Implementations of GtkCellLayout which also implement the GtkBuildable
    interface (`GtkCellView`, `GtkIconView`, `GtkComboBox`,
    `GtkEntryCompletion`, `GtkTreeViewColumn`) accept `GtkCellRenderer` objects
    as `<child>` elements in UI definitions. They support a custom `<attributes>`
    element for their children, which can contain multiple `<attribute>`
    elements. Each `<attribute>` element has a name attribute which specifies
    a property of the cell renderer; the content of the element is the
    attribute value.

    This is an example of a UI definition fragment specifying attributes:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkCellView">
      <child>
        <object class="GtkCellRendererText"/>
        <attributes>
          <attribute name="text">0</attribute>
        </attributes>
      </child>
    </object>
    ```

    Furthermore for implementations of `GtkCellLayout` that use a `GtkCellArea`
    to lay out cells (all `GtkCellLayout`s in GTK use a `GtkCellArea`)
    [cell properties](class.CellArea.html#cell-properties) can also be defined
    in the format by specifying the custom `<cell-packing>` attribute which can
    contain multiple `<property>` elements.

    Here is a UI definition fragment specifying cell properties:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkTreeViewColumn">
      <child>
        <object class="GtkCellRendererText"/>
        <cell-packing>
          <property name="align">True</property>
          <property name="expand">False</property>
        </cell-packing>
      </child>
    </object>
    ```

    ## Subclassing GtkCellLayout implementations

    When subclassing a widget that implements `GtkCellLayout` like
    `GtkIconView` or `GtkComboBox`, there are some considerations related
    to the fact that these widgets internally use a `GtkCellArea`.
    The cell area is exposed as a construct-only property by these
    widgets. This means that it is possible to e.g. do

    ```c
    GtkWIdget *combo =
      g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", my_cell_area, NULL);
    ```

    to use a custom cell area with a combo box. But construct properties
    are only initialized after instance `init()`
    functions have run, which means that using functions which rely on
    the existence of the cell area in your subclass `init()` function will
    cause the default cell area to be instantiated. In this case, a provided
    construct property value will be ignored (with a warning, to alert
    you to the problem).

    ```c
    static void
    my_combo_box_init (MyComboBox *b)
    {
      GtkCellRenderer *cell;

      cell = gtk_cell_renderer_pixbuf_new ();

      // The following call causes the default cell area for combo boxes,
      // a GtkCellAreaBox, to be instantiated
      gtk_cell_layout_pack_start (GTK_CELL_LAYOUT (b), cell, FALSE);
      ...
    }

    GtkWidget *
    my_combo_box_new (GtkCellArea *area)
    {
      // This call is going to cause a warning about area being ignored
      return g_object_new (MY_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", area, NULL);
    }
    ```

    If supporting alternative cell areas with your derived widget is
    not important, then this does not have to concern you. If you want
    to support alternative cell areas, you can do so by moving the
    problematic calls out of `init()` and into a `constructor()`
    for your class.

    """
    An object for rendering a single cell

    The `GtkCellRenderer` is a base class of a set of objects used for
    rendering a cell to a `cairo_t`.  These objects are used primarily by
    the `GtkTreeView` widget, though they aren’t tied to them in any
    specific way.  It is worth noting that `GtkCellRenderer` is not a
    `GtkWidget` and cannot be treated as such.

    The primary use of a `GtkCellRenderer` is for drawing a certain graphical
    elements on a `cairo_t`. Typically, one cell renderer is used to
    draw many cells on the screen.  To this extent, it isn’t expected that a
    CellRenderer keep any permanent state around.  Instead, any state is set
    just prior to use using `GObject`s property system.  Then, the
    cell is measured using gtk_cell_renderer_get_preferred_size(). Finally, the cell
    is rendered in the correct location using gtk_cell_renderer_snapshot().

    There are a number of rules that must be followed when writing a new
    `GtkCellRenderer`.  First and foremost, it’s important that a certain set
    of properties will always yield a cell renderer of the same size,
    barring a style change. The `GtkCellRenderer` also has a number of
    generic properties that are expected to be honored by all children.

    Beyond merely rendering a cell, cell renderers can optionally
    provide active user interface elements. A cell renderer can be
    “activatable” like `GtkCellRenderer`Toggle,
    which toggles when it gets activated by a mouse click, or it can be
    “editable” like `GtkCellRenderer`Text, which
    allows the user to edit the text using a widget implementing the
    `GtkCellEditable` interface, e.g. `GtkEntry`.
    To make a cell renderer activatable or editable, you have to
    implement the `GtkCellRenderer`Class.activate or
    `GtkCellRenderer`Class.start_editing virtual functions, respectively.

    Many properties of `GtkCellRenderer` and its subclasses have a
    corresponding “set” property, e.g. “cell-background-set” corresponds
    to “cell-background”. These “set” properties reflect whether a property
    has been set or not. You should not set them independently.

    instead of actual progress.

    property to %TRUE and increment the `GtkCellRendererSpinner:pulse` property

    </picture>

    A `GtkCheckButton` is created by calling either [ctor@Gtk.CheckButton.new]
    or [ctor@Gtk.CheckButton.new_with_label].

    The state of a `GtkCheckButton` can be set specifically using
    [method@Gtk.CheckButton.set_active], and retrieved using
    [method@Gtk.CheckButton.get_active].

    # Inconsistent state

    In addition to "on" and "off", check buttons can be an
    "in between" state that is neither on nor off. This can be used
    e.g. when the user has selected a range of elements (such as some
    text or spreadsheet cells) that are affected by a check button,
    and the current values in that range are inconsistent.

    To set a `GtkCheckButton` to inconsistent state, use
    [method@Gtk.CheckButton.set_inconsistent].

    # Grouping

    Check buttons can be grouped together, to form mutually exclusive
    groups - only one of the buttons can be toggled at a time, and toggling
    another one will switch the currently toggled one off.

    Grouped check buttons use a different indicator, and are commonly referred
    to as *radio buttons*.

    <picture>
      <source srcset="radio-button-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="Example GtkRadioButtons" src="radio-button.png">
    </picture>

    To add a `GtkCheckButton` to a group, use [method@Gtk.CheckButton.set_group].

    When the code must keep track of the state of a group of radio buttons, it
    is recommended to keep track of such state through a stateful
    `GAction` with a target for each button. Using the `toggled` signals to keep
    track of the group changes and state is discouraged.

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkCheckButton` supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - <kbd>␣</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> activates the button.

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    checkbutton[.text-button][.grouped]
    ├── check
    ╰── [label]
    ```

    A `GtkCheckButton` has a main node with name checkbutton. If the
    [property@Gtk.CheckButton:label] or [property@Gtk.CheckButton:child]
    properties are set, it contains a child widget. The indicator node
    is named check when no group is set, and radio if the checkbutton
    is grouped together with other checkbuttons.

    `GtkCheckButton` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.checkbox] role.

class ColumnView(Widget):
    """
    Presents a large dynamic list of items using multiple columns with headers.

    `GtkColumnView` uses the factories of its columns to generate a cell widget for
    each column, for each visible item and displays them together as the row for
    this item.

    The [property@Gtk.ColumnView:show-row-separators] and
    [property@Gtk.ColumnView:show-column-separators] properties offer a simple way
    to display separators between the rows or columns.

    `GtkColumnView` allows the user to select items according to the selection
    characteristics of the model. For models that allow multiple selected items,
    it is possible to turn on *rubberband selection*, using
    [property@Gtk.ColumnView:enable-rubberband].

    The column view supports sorting that can be customized by the user by
    clicking on column headers. To set this up, the `GtkSorter` returned by
    [method@Gtk.ColumnView.get_sorter] must be attached to a sort model for the
    data that the view is showing, and the columns must have sorters attached to
    them by calling [method@Gtk.ColumnViewColumn.set_sorter]. The initial sort
    order can be set with [method@Gtk.ColumnView.sort_by_column].

    The column view also supports interactive resizing and reordering of
    columns, via Drag-and-Drop of the column headers. This can be enabled or
    disabled with the [property@Gtk.ColumnView:reorderable] and
    [property@Gtk.ColumnViewColumn:resizable] properties.

    To learn more about the list widget framework, see the
    [overview](section-list-widget.html).

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    columnview[.column-separators][.rich-list][.navigation-sidebar][.data-table]
    ├── header
    │   ├── <column header>
    ┊   ┊
    │   ╰── <column header>
    │
    ├── listview
    │
    ┊
    ╰── [rubberband]
    ```

    `GtkColumnView` uses a single CSS node named columnview. It may carry the
    .column-separators style class, when [property@Gtk.ColumnView:show-column-separators]
    property is set. Header widgets appear below a node with name header.
    The rows are contained in a `GtkListView` widget, so there is a listview
    node with the same structure as for a standalone `GtkListView` widget.
    If [property@Gtk.ColumnView:show-row-separators] is set, it will be passed
    on to the list view, causing its CSS node to carry the .separators style class.
    For rubberband selection, a node with name rubberband is used.

    The main columnview node may also carry style classes to select
    the style of [list presentation](section-list-widget.html#list-styles):
    .rich-list, .navigation-sidebar or .data-table.

    # Accessibility

    `GtkColumnView` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.tree_grid] role, header title
    widgets are using the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.column_header] role. The row widgets
    are using the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.row] role, and individual cells are using
    the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.grid_cell] role

    A `GtkComboBox` is a widget that allows the user to choose from a list of
    valid choices.

    <picture>
      <source srcset="combo-box-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An example GtkComboBox" src="combo-box.png">
    </picture>

    The `GtkComboBox` displays the selected choice; when activated, the
    `GtkComboBox` displays a popup which allows the user to make a new choice.

    The `GtkComboBox` uses the model-view pattern; the list of valid choices
    is specified in the form of a tree model, and the display of the choices
    can be adapted to the data in the model by using cell renderers, as you
    would in a tree view. This is possible since `GtkComboBox` implements the
    [iface@Gtk.CellLayout] interface. The tree model holding the valid
    choices is not restricted to a flat list, it can be a real tree, and the
    popup will reflect the tree structure.

    To allow the user to enter values not in the model, the
    [property@Gtk.ComboBox:has-entry] property allows the `GtkComboBox` to
    contain a [class@Gtk.Entry]. This entry can be accessed by calling
    [method@Gtk.ComboBox.get_child] on the combo box.

    For a simple list of textual choices, the model-view API of `GtkComboBox`
    can be a bit overwhelming. In this case, [class@Gtk.ComboBoxText] offers
    a simple alternative. Both `GtkComboBox` and `GtkComboBoxText` can contain
    an entry.

    ```
    combobox

    │           ├── cellview
    │           ╰── arrow
    ╰── window.popup
    ```

    A normal combobox contains a box with the .linked class, a button
    with the .combo class and inside those buttons, there are a cellview and
    an arrow.

    ```

    A `GtkComboBox` with an entry has a single CSS node with name combobox.
    It contains a box with the .linked class. That box contains an entry and
    a button, both with the .combo class added. The button also contains another
    node with name arrow.

    A `GtkComboBoxText` is a simple variant of `GtkComboBox` for text-only
    use cases.

    <picture>
      <source srcset="combo-box-text-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An example GtkComboBoxText" src="combo-box-text.png">
    </picture>

    `GtkComboBoxText` hides the model-view complexity of `GtkComboBox`.

    To create a `GtkComboBoxText`, use [ctor@Gtk.ComboBoxText.new] or
    [ctor@Gtk.ComboBoxText.new_with_entry].

    You can add items to a `GtkComboBoxText` with
    [method@Gtk.ComboBoxText.append_text],
    [method@Gtk.ComboBoxText.insert_text] or
    [method@Gtk.ComboBoxText.prepend_text] and remove options with
    [method@Gtk.ComboBoxText.remove].

    If the `GtkComboBoxText` contains an entry (via the
    [property@Gtk.ComboBox:has-entry] property), its contents can be retrieved
    using [method@Gtk.ComboBoxText.get_active_text].

    You should not call [method@Gtk.ComboBox.set_model] or attempt to pack more
    cells into this combo box via its [iface@Gtk.CellLayout] interface.

    ## GtkComboBoxText as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkComboBoxText` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface supports
    adding items directly using the `<items>` element and specifying `<item>`
    elements for each item. Each `<item>` element can specify the “id”
    corresponding to the appended text and also supports the regular
    translation attributes “translatable”, “context” and “comments”.

    Here is a UI definition fragment specifying `GtkComboBoxText` items:
    ```xml
    <object class="GtkComboBoxText">
      <items>
        <item translatable="yes" id="factory">Factory</item>
        <item translatable="yes" id="home">Home</item>
        <item translatable="yes" id="subway">Subway</item>
      </items>
    </object>
    ```

    ## CSS nodes

    ```
    combobox
    ╰── box.linked
        ├── entry.combo
        ├── button.combo
        ╰── window.popup
    ```

    `GtkComboBoxText` has a single CSS node with name combobox. It adds
    the style class .combo to the main CSS nodes of its entry and button
    children, and the .linked class to the node of its internal box.

class ConstraintLayout(LayoutManager):
    """
    Uses constraints to describe relations between widgets.

    `GtkConstraintLayout` is a layout manager that uses relations between
    widget attributes, expressed via [class@Gtk.Constraint] instances, to
    measure and allocate widgets.

    ### How do constraints work

    Constraints are objects defining the relationship between attributes
    of a widget; you can read the description of the [class@Gtk.Constraint]
    class to have a more in depth definition.

    By taking multiple constraints and applying them to the children of
    a widget using `GtkConstraintLayout`, it's possible to describe
    complex layout policies; each constraint applied to a child or to the parent
    widgets contributes to the full description of the layout, in terms of
    parameters for resolving the value of each attribute.

    It is important to note that a layout is defined by the totality of
    constraints; removing a child, or a constraint, from an existing layout
    without changing the remaining constraints may result in an unstable
    or unsolvable layout.

    Constraints have an implicit "reading order"; you should start describing
    each edge of each child, as well as their relationship with the parent
    container, from the top left (or top right, in RTL languages), horizontally
    first, and then vertically.

    A constraint-based layout with too few constraints can become "unstable",
    that is: have more than one solution. The behavior of an unstable layout
    is undefined.

    A constraint-based layout with conflicting constraints may be unsolvable,
    and lead to an unstable layout. You can use the [property@Gtk.Constraint:strength]
    property of [class@Gtk.Constraint] to "nudge" the layout towards a solution.

    ### GtkConstraintLayout as GtkBuildable

    `GtkConstraintLayout` implements the [iface@Gtk.Buildable] interface and
    has a custom "constraints" element which allows describing constraints in
    a [class@Gtk.Builder] UI file.

    An example of a UI definition fragment specifying a constraint:

    ```xml
      <object class="GtkConstraintLayout">
        <constraints>
          <constraint target="button" target-attribute="start"
                      relation="eq"
                      source="super" source-attribute="start"
                      constant="12"
                      strength="required" />
          <constraint target="button" target-attribute="width"
                      relation="ge"
                      constant="250"
                      strength="strong" />
        </constraints>
      </object>
    ```

    The definition above will add two constraints to the GtkConstraintLayout:

     - a required constraint between the leading edge of "button" and
       the leading edge of the widget using the constraint layout, plus
       12 pixels
     - a strong, constant constraint making the width of "button" greater
       than, or equal to 250 pixels

    The "target" and "target-attribute" attributes are required.

    The "source" and "source-attribute" attributes of the "constraint"
    element are optional; if they are not specified, the constraint is
    assumed to be a constant.

    The "relation" attribute is optional; if not specified, the constraint
    is assumed to be an equality.

    The "strength" attribute is optional; if not specified, the constraint
    is assumed to be required.

    The "source" and "target" attributes can be set to "super" to indicate
    that the constraint target is the widget using the GtkConstraintLayout.

    There can be "constant" and "multiplier" attributes.

    Additionally, the "constraints" element can also contain a description
    of the `GtkConstraintGuides` used by the layout:

    ```xml
      <constraints>
        <guide min-width="100" max-width="500" name="hspace"/>
        <guide min-height="64" nat-height="128" name="vspace" strength="strong"/>
      </constraints>
    ```

    The "guide" element has the following optional attributes:

      - "min-width", "nat-width", and "max-width", describe the minimum,
        natural, and maximum width of the guide, respectively
      - "min-height", "nat-height", and "max-height", describe the minimum,
        natural, and maximum height of the guide, respectively
      - "strength" describes the strength of the constraint on the natural
        size of the guide; if not specified, the constraint is assumed to
        have a medium strength
      - "name" describes a name for the guide, useful when debugging

    ### Using the Visual Format Language

    Complex constraints can be described using a compact syntax called VFL,
    or *Visual Format Language*.

    The Visual Format Language describes all the constraints on a row or
    column, typically starting from the leading edge towards the trailing
    one. Each element of the layout is composed by "views", which identify
    a [iface@Gtk.ConstraintTarget].

    For instance:

    ```
      [button]-[textField]
    ```

    Describes a constraint that binds the trailing edge of "button" to the
    leading edge of "textField", leaving a default space between the two.

    Using VFL is also possible to specify predicates that describe constraints
    on attributes like width and height:

    ```
      // Width must be greater than, or equal to 50
      [button(>=50)]

      // Width of button1 must be equal to width of button2
      [button1(==button2)]
    ```

    The default orientation for a VFL description is horizontal, unless
    otherwise specified:

    ```
      // horizontal orientation, default attribute: width
      H:[button(>=150)]

      // vertical orientation, default attribute: height
      V:[button1(==button2)]
    ```

    It's also possible to specify multiple predicates, as well as their
    strength:

    ```
      // minimum width of button must be 150
      // natural width of button can be 250
      [button(>=150@required, ==250@medium)]
    ```

    Finally, it's also possible to use simple arithmetic operators:

    ```
      // width of button1 must be equal to width of button2
      // divided by 2 plus 12
      [button1(button2 / 2 + 12)]
    ```

    Dialogs are a convenient way to prompt the user for a small amount

      <source srcset="dialog-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An example GtkDialog" src="dialog.png">
    </picture>

    Typical uses are to display a message, ask a question, or anything else
    that does not require extensive effort on the user’s part.

    The main area of a `GtkDialog` is called the "content area", and is yours
    to populate with widgets such a `GtkLabel` or `GtkEntry`, to present
    your information, questions, or tasks to the user.

    In addition, dialogs allow you to add "action widgets". Most commonly,
    action widgets are buttons. Depending on the platform, action widgets may
    be presented in the header bar at the top of the window, or at the bottom
    of the window. To add action widgets, create your `GtkDialog` using
    [ctor@Gtk.Dialog.new_with_buttons], or use
    [method@Gtk.Dialog.add_button], [method@Gtk.Dialog.add_buttons],
    or [method@Gtk.Dialog.add_action_widget].

    `GtkDialogs` uses some heuristics to decide whether to add a close
    button to the window decorations. If any of the action buttons use
    the response ID %GTK_RESPONSE_CLOSE or %GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL, the
    close button is omitted.

    Clicking a button that was added as an action widget will emit the
    [signal@Gtk.Dialog::response] signal with a response ID that you specified.
    GTK will never assign a meaning to positive response IDs; these are
    entirely user-defined. But for convenience, you can use the response
    IDs in the [enum@Gtk.ResponseType] enumeration (these all have values
    less than zero). If a dialog receives a delete event, the
    [signal@Gtk.Dialog::response] signal will be emitted with the
    %GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT response ID.

    Dialogs are created with a call to [ctor@Gtk.Dialog.new] or
    [ctor@Gtk.Dialog.new_with_buttons]. The latter is recommended; it allows
    you to set the dialog title, some convenient flags, and add buttons.

    A “modal” dialog (that is, one which freezes the rest of the application
    from user input), can be created by calling [method@Gtk.Window.set_modal]
    on the dialog. When using [ctor@Gtk.Dialog.new_with_buttons], you can also
    pass the %GTK_DIALOG_MODAL flag to make a dialog modal.

    For the simple dialog in the following example, a [class@Gtk.MessageDialog]
    would save some effort. But you’d need to create the dialog contents manually
    if you had more than a simple message in the dialog.

    An example for simple `GtkDialog` usage:

    ```c
    // Function to open a dialog box with a message
    void
    quick_message (GtkWindow *parent, char *message)
    {
     GtkWidget *dialog, *label, *content_area;
     GtkDialogFlags flags;

     // Create the widgets
     flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
     dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("Message",
                                           parent,
                                           flags,
                                           _("_OK"),
                                           GTK_RESPONSE_NONE,
                                           NULL);
     content_area = gtk_dialog_get_content_area (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
     label = gtk_label_new (message);

     // Ensure that the dialog box is destroyed when the user responds

     g_signal_connect_swapped (dialog,
                               "response",
                               G_CALLBACK (gtk_window_destroy),
                               dialog);

     // Add the label, and show everything we’ve added

     gtk_box_append (GTK_BOX (content_area), label);
     gtk_widget_show (dialog);
    }
    ```

    # GtkDialog as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkDialog` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface exposes the
    @content_area as an internal child with the name “content_area”.

    `GtkDialog` supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
    multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
    numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
    (which should be a child of the dialogs @action_area). To mark a response
    as default, set the “default” attribute of the `<action-widget>` element
    to true.

    `GtkDialog` supports adding action widgets by specifying “action” as
    the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element. The widget will be added
    either to the action area or the headerbar of the dialog, depending
    on the “use-header-bar” property. The response id has to be associated
    with the action widget using the `<action-widgets>` element.

    An example of a `GtkDialog` UI definition fragment:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
      <child type="action">
        <object class="GtkButton" id="button_cancel"/>
      </child>
      <child type="action">
        <object class="GtkButton" id="button_ok">
        </object>
      </child>
      <action-widgets>
        <action-widget response="cancel">button_cancel</action-widget>
        <action-widget response="ok" default="true">button_ok</action-widget>
      </action-widgets>
    </object>
    ```

class DragSource(GestureSingle):
    """
    An event controller to initiate Drag-And-Drop operations.

    `GtkDragSource` can be set up with the necessary
    ingredients for a DND operation ahead of time. This includes
    the source for the data that is being transferred, in the form
    of a [class@Gdk.ContentProvider], the desired action, and the icon to
    use during the drag operation. After setting it up, the drag
    source must be added to a widget as an event controller, using
    [method@Gtk.Widget.add_controller].

    ```c
    static void
    my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
    {
      GtkDragSource *drag_source = gtk_drag_source_new ();

      g_signal_connect (drag_source, "prepare", G_CALLBACK (on_drag_prepare), self);
      g_signal_connect (drag_source, "drag-begin", G_CALLBACK (on_drag_begin), self);

      gtk_widget_add_controller (GTK_WIDGET (self), GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER (drag_source));
    }
    ```

    Setting up the content provider and icon ahead of time only makes
    sense when the data does not change. More commonly, you will want
    to set them up just in time. To do so, `GtkDragSource` has
    [signal@Gtk.DragSource::prepare] and [signal@Gtk.DragSource::drag-begin]
    signals.

    The ::prepare signal is emitted before a drag is started, and
    can be used to set the content provider and actions that the
    drag should be started with.

    ```c
    static GdkContentProvider *
    on_drag_prepare (GtkDragSource *source,
                     double         x,
                     double         y,
                     MyWidget      *self)
    {
      // This widget supports two types of content: GFile objects
      // and GdkPixbuf objects; GTK will handle the serialization
      // of these types automatically
      GFile *file = my_widget_get_file (self);
      GdkPixbuf *pixbuf = my_widget_get_pixbuf (self);

      return gdk_content_provider_new_union ((GdkContentProvider *[2]) {
          gdk_content_provider_new_typed (G_TYPE_FILE, file),
          gdk_content_provider_new_typed (GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF, pixbuf),
        }, 2);
    }
    ```

    The ::drag-begin signal is emitted after the `GdkDrag` object has
    been created, and can be used to set up the drag icon.

    ```c
    static void
    on_drag_begin (GtkDragSource *source,
                   GdkDrag       *drag,
                   MyWidget      *self)
    {
      // Set the widget as the drag icon
      GdkPaintable *paintable = gtk_widget_paintable_new (GTK_WIDGET (self));
      gtk_drag_source_set_icon (source, paintable, 0, 0);
      g_object_unref (paintable);
    }
    ```

    During the DND operation, `GtkDragSource` emits signals that
    can be used to obtain updates about the status of the operation,
    but it is not normally necessary to connect to any signals,
    except for one case: when the supported actions include
    %GDK_ACTION_MOVE, you need to listen for the
    [signal@Gtk.DragSource::drag-end] signal and delete the
    data after it has been transferred.

    It’s essentially a blank widget; you can draw on it. After
    creating a drawing area, the application may want to connect to:

    - The [signal@Gtk.Widget::realize] signal to take any necessary actions
      when the widget is instantiated on a particular display.
      (Create GDK resources in response to this signal.)

    - The [signal@Gtk.DrawingArea::resize] signal to take any necessary
      actions when the widget changes size.

    - Call [method@Gtk.DrawingArea.set_draw_func] to handle redrawing the
      contents of the widget.

    The following code portion demonstrates using a drawing
    area to display a circle in the normal widget foreground
    color.

    ## Simple GtkDrawingArea usage

    ```c
    static void
    draw_function (GtkDrawingArea *area,
                   cairo_t        *cr,
                   int             width,
                   int             height,
                   gpointer        data)
    {
      GdkRGBA color;

      cairo_arc (cr,
                 width / 2.0, height / 2.0,
                 MIN (width, height) / 2.0,
                 0, 2 * G_PI);

      gtk_widget_get_color (GTK_WIDGET (area),
                            &color);
      gdk_cairo_set_source_rgba (cr, &color);

      cairo_fill (cr);
    }

    int
    main (int argc, char **argv)
    {
      gtk_init ();

      GtkWidget *area = gtk_drawing_area_new ();
      gtk_drawing_area_set_content_width (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area), 100);
      gtk_drawing_area_set_content_height (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area), 100);
      gtk_drawing_area_set_draw_func (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area),
                                      draw_function,
                                      NULL, NULL);
      return 0;
    }
    ```

    The draw function is normally called when a drawing area first comes
    onscreen, or when it’s covered by another window and then uncovered.
    You can also force a redraw by adding to the “damage region” of the
    drawing area’s window using [method@Gtk.Widget.queue_draw].
    This will cause the drawing area to call the draw function again.

    The available routines for drawing are documented in the
    [Cairo documentation](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/); GDK
    offers additional API to integrate with Cairo, like [func@Gdk.cairo_set_source_rgba]
    or [func@Gdk.cairo_set_source_pixbuf].

    To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to use
    event controllers. To receive keyboard events, you will need to set
    the “can-focus” property on the drawing area, and you should probably
    draw some user-visible indication that the drawing area is focused.

    If you need more complex control over your widget, you should consider
    creating your own `GtkWidget` subclass.

    The `GtkDropDown` displays the [selected][property@Gtk.DropDown:selected]
    choice.

    The options are given to `GtkDropDown` in the form of `GListModel`
    and how the individual options are represented is determined by
    a [class@Gtk.ListItemFactory]. The default factory displays simple strings,
    and adds a checkmark to the selected item in the popup.

    To set your own factory, use [method@Gtk.DropDown.set_factory]. It is
    possible to use a separate factory for the items in the popup, with
    [method@Gtk.DropDown.set_list_factory].

    `GtkDropDown` knows how to obtain strings from the items in a
    [class@Gtk.StringList]; for other models, you have to provide an expression
    to find the strings via [method@Gtk.DropDown.set_expression].

    `GtkDropDown` can optionally allow search in the popup, which is
    useful if the list of options is long. To enable the search entry,
    use [method@Gtk.DropDown.set_enable_search].

    Here is a UI definition example for `GtkDropDown` with a simple model:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkDropDown">
      <property name="model">
        <object class="GtkStringList">
          <items>
            <item translatable="yes">Factory</item>
            <item translatable="yes">Home</item>
            <item translatable="yes">Subway</item>
          </items>
        </object>
      </property>
    </object>
    ```

    If a `GtkDropDown` is created in this manner, or with
    [ctor@Gtk.DropDown.new_from_strings], for instance, the object returned from
    [method@Gtk.DropDown.get_selected_item] will be a [class@Gtk.StringObject].

    To learn more about the list widget framework, see the
    [overview](section-list-widget.html).

    ## CSS nodes

    `GtkDropDown` has a single CSS node with name dropdown,
    with the button and popover nodes as children.

    `GtkDropDown` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.combo_box] role.

class DropTarget(EventController):

    An event controller to receive Drag-and-Drop operations.

    The most basic way to use a `GtkDropTarget` to receive drops on a
    widget is to create it via [ctor@Gtk.DropTarget.new], passing in the
    `GType` of the data you want to receive and connect to the
    [signal@Gtk.DropTarget::drop] signal to receive the data:

    ```c
    static gboolean
    on_drop (GtkDropTarget *target,
             const GValue  *value,
             double         x,
             double         y,
             gpointer       data)
    {
      MyWidget *self = data;

      // Call the appropriate setter depending on the type of data
      // that we received
      if (G_VALUE_HOLDS (value, G_TYPE_FILE))
        my_widget_set_file (self, g_value_get_object (value));
      else if (G_VALUE_HOLDS (value, GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF))
        my_widget_set_pixbuf (self, g_value_get_object (value));
      else
        return FALSE;

      return TRUE;
    }

    static void
    my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
    {
      GtkDropTarget *target =
        gtk_drop_target_new (G_TYPE_INVALID, GDK_ACTION_COPY);

      // This widget accepts two types of drop types: GFile objects
      // and GdkPixbuf objects
      gtk_drop_target_set_gtypes (target, (GType [2]) {
        G_TYPE_FILE,
        GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF,
      }, 2);

      g_signal_connect (target, "drop", G_CALLBACK (on_drop), self);
      gtk_widget_add_controller (GTK_WIDGET (self), GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER (target));
    }
    ```

    `GtkDropTarget` supports more options, such as:

     * rejecting potential drops via the [signal@Gtk.DropTarget::accept] signal
       and the [method@Gtk.DropTarget.reject] function to let other drop
       targets handle the drop
     * tracking an ongoing drag operation before the drop via the
       [signal@Gtk.DropTarget::enter], [signal@Gtk.DropTarget::motion] and
       [signal@Gtk.DropTarget::leave] signals
     * configuring how to receive data by setting the
       [property@Gtk.DropTarget:preload] property and listening for its
       availability via the [property@Gtk.DropTarget:value] property

    However, `GtkDropTarget` is ultimately modeled in a synchronous way
    and only supports data transferred via `GType`. If you want full control
    over an ongoing drop, the [class@Gtk.DropTargetAsync] object gives you
    this ability.

    While a pointer is dragged over the drop target's widget and the drop
    has not been rejected, that widget will receive the
    %GTK_STATE_FLAG_DROP_ACTIVE state, which can be used to style the widget.

    If you are not interested in receiving the drop, but just want to update
    UI state during a Drag-and-Drop operation (e.g. switching tabs), you can
    use [class@Gtk.DropControllerMotion].

        The default value for this property is %FALSE to avoid downloading
        huge amounts of data by accident.

        For example, if somebody drags a full document of gigabytes of text

        this data will be downloaded, even if the data is ultimately dropped
        elsewhere.

        %GDK_TYPE_RGBA), so enabling this property does not hurt at all.

class DropTargetAsync(EventController):
    """
    An event controller to receive Drag-and-Drop operations, asynchronously.

    It is the more complete but also more complex method of handling drop
    operations compared to [class@Gtk.DropTarget], and you should only use
    it if `GtkDropTarget` doesn't provide all the features you need.

    To use a `GtkDropTargetAsync` to receive drops on a widget, you create
    a `GtkDropTargetAsync` object, configure which data formats and actions
    you support, connect to its signals, and then attach it to the widget
    with [method@Gtk.Widget.add_controller].

    During a drag operation, the first signal that a `GtkDropTargetAsync`
    emits is [signal@Gtk.DropTargetAsync::accept], which is meant to determine
    whether the target is a possible drop site for the ongoing drop. The
    default handler for the ::accept signal accepts the drop if it finds
    a compatible data format and an action that is supported on both sides.

    If it is, and the widget becomes a target, you will receive a
    [signal@Gtk.DropTargetAsync::drag-enter] signal, followed by
    [signal@Gtk.DropTargetAsync::drag-motion] signals as the pointer moves,
    optionally a [signal@Gtk.DropTargetAsync::drop] signal when a drop happens,
    and finally a [signal@Gtk.DropTargetAsync::drag-leave] signal when the
    pointer moves off the widget.

    The ::drag-enter and ::drag-motion handler return a `GdkDragAction`
    to update the status of the ongoing operation. The ::drop handler
    should decide if it ultimately accepts the drop and if it does, it
    should initiate the data transfer and finish the operation by calling
    [method@Gdk.Drop.finish].

    Between the ::drag-enter and ::drag-leave signals the widget is a
    current drop target, and will receive the %GTK_STATE_FLAG_DROP_ACTIVE
    state, which can be used by themes to style the widget as a drop target.

    ## Implementing GtkEditable

    The most likely scenario for implementing `GtkEditable` on your own widget
    is that you will embed a `GtkText` inside a complex widget, and want to
    delegate the editable functionality to that text widget. `GtkEditable`
    provides some utility functions to make this easy.

    In your class_init function, call [func@Gtk.Editable.install_properties],
    passing the first available property ID:

    ```c
    static void
    my_class_init (MyClass *class)
    {
      ...
      g_object_class_install_properties (object_class, NUM_PROPERTIES, props);
      gtk_editable_install_properties (object_clas, NUM_PROPERTIES);
      ...
    }
    ```

    In your interface_init function for the `GtkEditable` interface, provide
    an implementation for the get_delegate vfunc that returns your text widget:

    ```c
    GtkEditable *
    get_editable_delegate (GtkEditable *editable)
    {
      return GTK_EDITABLE (MY_WIDGET (editable)->text_widget);
    }

    static void
    my_editable_init (GtkEditableInterface *iface)
    {
      iface->get_delegate = get_editable_delegate;
    }
    ```

    You don't need to provide any other vfuncs. The default implementations
    work by forwarding to the delegate that the GtkEditableInterface.get_delegate()
    vfunc returns.

    In your instance_init function, create your text widget, and then call
    [method@Gtk.Editable.init_delegate]:

    ```c
    static void
    my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
    {
      ...
      self->text_widget = gtk_text_new ();
      gtk_editable_init_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
      ...
    }
    ```

    In your dispose function, call [method@Gtk.Editable.finish_delegate] before
    destroying your text widget:

    ```c
    static void
    my_widget_dispose (GObject *object)
    {
      ...
      gtk_editable_finish_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
      g_clear_pointer (&self->text_widget, gtk_widget_unparent);
      ...
    }
    ```

    Finally, use [func@Gtk.Editable.delegate_set_property] in your `set_property`
    function (and similar for `get_property`), to set the editable properties:

    ```c
      ...
      if (gtk_editable_delegate_set_property (object, prop_id, value, pspec))
        return;

      switch (prop_id)
      ...
    ```

    It is important to note that if you create a `GtkEditable` that uses
    a delegate, the low level [signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text] and
    [signal@Gtk.Editable::delete-text] signals will be propagated from the
    "wrapper" editable to the delegate, but they will not be propagated from
    the delegate to the "wrapper" editable, as they would cause an infinite
    recursion. If you wish to connect to the [signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text]
    and [signal@Gtk.Editable::delete-text] signals, you will need to connect
    to them on the delegate obtained via [method@Gtk.Editable.get_delegate].

        the parent of the delegate, and, as a result, will not work properly.

    A fairly large set of key bindings are supported by default. If the
    entered text is longer than the allocation of the widget, the widget
    will scroll so that the cursor position is visible.

    When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information, it
    can be put into “password mode” using [method@Gtk.Entry.set_visibility].
    In this mode, entered text is displayed using a “invisible” character.
    By default, GTK picks the best invisible character that is available
    in the current font, but it can be changed with
    [method@Gtk.Entry.set_invisible_char].

    `GtkEntry` has the ability to display progress or activity
    information behind the text. To make an entry display such information,
    use [method@Gtk.Entry.set_progress_fraction] or
    [method@Gtk.Entry.set_progress_pulse_step].

    Additionally, `GtkEntry` can show icons at either side of the entry.
    These icons can be activatable by clicking, can be set up as drag source
    and can have tooltips. To add an icon, use
    [method@Gtk.Entry.set_icon_from_gicon] or one of the various other functions
    that set an icon from an icon name or a paintable. To trigger an action when
    the user clicks an icon, connect to the [signal@Gtk.Entry::icon-press] signal.
    To allow DND operations from an icon, use
    [method@Gtk.Entry.set_icon_drag_source]. To set a tooltip on an icon, use
    [method@Gtk.Entry.set_icon_tooltip_text] or the corresponding function
    for markup.

    Note that functionality or information that is only available by clicking
    on an icon in an entry may not be accessible at all to users which are not
    able to use a mouse or other pointing device. It is therefore recommended
    that any such functionality should also be available by other means, e.g.
    via the context menu of the entry.

    # CSS nodes

    ```

    `GtkEntry` has a main node with the name entry. Depending on the properties
    of the entry, the style classes .read-only and .flat may appear. The style
    classes .warning and .error may also be used with entries.

    When the entry shows icons, it adds subnodes with the name image and the
    style class .left or .right, depending on where the icon appears.

    When the entry shows progress, it adds a subnode with the name progress.
    The node has the style class .pulse when the shown progress is pulsing.

    For all the subnodes added to the text node in various situations,
    see [class@Gtk.Text].

    # GtkEntry as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkEntry` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface supports a
    custom `<attributes>` element, which supports any number of `<attribute>`
    elements. The `<attribute>` element has attributes named “name“, “value“,
    “start“ and “end“ and allows you to specify `PangoAttribute` values for
    this label.

    An example of a UI definition fragment specifying Pango attributes:
    ```xml
    <object class="GtkEntry">
      <attributes>
        <attribute name="weight" value="PANGO_WEIGHT_BOLD"/>
        <attribute name="background" value="red" start="5" end="10"/>
      </attributes>
    </object>
    ```

    The start and end attributes specify the range of characters to which the
    Pango attribute applies. If start and end are not specified, the attribute
    is applied to the whole text. Note that specifying ranges does not make much
    sense with translatable attributes. Use markup embedded in the translatable
    content instead.

class EntryCompletion(GObject.Object):
    """
    `GtkEntryCompletion` is an auxiliary object to provide completion functionality
    for `GtkEntry`.

    It implements the [iface@Gtk.CellLayout] interface, to allow the user
    to add extra cells to the `GtkTreeView` with completion matches.

    “Completion functionality” means that when the user modifies the text
    in the entry, `GtkEntryCompletion` checks which rows in the model match
    the current content of the entry, and displays a list of matches.
    By default, the matching is done by comparing the entry text
    case-insensitively against the text column of the model (see
    [method@Gtk.EntryCompletion.set_text_column]), but this can be overridden
    with a custom match function (see [method@Gtk.EntryCompletion.set_match_func]).

    When the user selects a completion, the content of the entry is
    updated. By default, the content of the entry is replaced by the
    text column of the model, but this can be overridden by connecting
    to the [signal@Gtk.EntryCompletion::match-selected] signal and updating the
    entry in the signal handler. Note that you should return %TRUE from
    the signal handler to suppress the default behaviour.

    To add completion functionality to an entry, use
    [method@Gtk.Entry.set_completion].

    `GtkEntryCompletion` uses a [class@Gtk.TreeModelFilter] model to
    represent the subset of the entire model that is currently matching.
    While the `GtkEntryCompletion` signals
    [signal@Gtk.EntryCompletion::match-selected] and
    [signal@Gtk.EntryCompletion::cursor-on-match] take the original model
    and an iter pointing to that model as arguments, other callbacks and
    signals (such as `GtkCellLayoutDataFunc` or
    [signal@Gtk.CellArea::apply-attributes)]
    will generally take the filter model as argument. As long as you are
    only calling [method@Gtk.TreeModel.get], this will make no difference to
    you. If for some reason, you need the original model, use
    [method@Gtk.TreeModelFilter.get_model]. Don’t forget to use
    [method@Gtk.TreeModelFilter.convert_iter_to_child_iter] to obtain a
    matching iter.

    Handles scroll events.

    It is capable of handling both discrete and continuous scroll
    events from mice or touchpads, abstracting them both with the
    [signal@Gtk.EventControllerScroll::scroll] signal. Deltas in
    the discrete case are multiples of 1.

    In the case of continuous scroll events, `GtkEventControllerScroll`
    encloses all [signal@Gtk.EventControllerScroll::scroll] emissions
    between two [signal@Gtk.EventControllerScroll::scroll-begin] and
    [signal@Gtk.EventControllerScroll::scroll-end] signals.

    The behavior of the event controller can be modified by the flags
    given at creation time, or modified at a later point through
    [method@Gtk.EventControllerScroll.set_flags] (e.g. because the scrolling
    conditions of the widget changed).

    The controller can be set up to emit motion for either/both vertical
    and horizontal scroll events through %GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_VERTICAL,
    %GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_HORIZONTAL and %GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_BOTH_AXES.
    If any axis is disabled, the respective [signal@Gtk.EventControllerScroll::scroll]
    delta will be 0. Vertical scroll events will be translated to horizontal
    motion for the devices incapable of horizontal scrolling.

    The event controller can also be forced to emit discrete events on all
    devices through %GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_DISCRETE. This can be used
    to implement discrete actions triggered through scroll events (e.g.
    switching across combobox options).

    The %GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER_SCROLL_KINETIC flag toggles the emission of the
    [signal@Gtk.EventControllerScroll::decelerate] signal, emitted at the end
    of scrolling with two X/Y velocity arguments that are consistent with the
    motion that was received.

    This is similar to the triangles used in a `GtkTreeView`.

    Normally you use an expander as you would use a frame; you create
    the child widget and use [method@Gtk.Expander.set_child] to add it
    to the expander. When the expander is toggled, it will take care of
    showing and hiding the child automatically.

    # Special Usage

    There are situations in which you may prefer to show and hide the
    expanded widget yourself, such as when you want to actually create
    the widget at expansion time. In this case, create a `GtkExpander`
    but do not add a child to it. The expander widget has an
    [property@Gtk.Expander:expanded] property which can be used to
    monitor its expansion state. You should watch this property with
    a signal connection as follows:

    ```c
    static void
    expander_callback (GObject    *object,
                       GParamSpec *param_spec,
                       gpointer    user_data)
    {
      GtkExpander *expander;

      expander = GTK_EXPANDER (object);

      if (gtk_expander_get_expanded (expander))
        {
          // Show or create widgets
        }
      else
        {
          // Hide or destroy widgets
        }
    }

    static void
    create_expander (void)
    {
      GtkWidget *expander = gtk_expander_new_with_mnemonic ("_More Options");
      g_signal_connect (expander, "notify::expanded",
                        G_CALLBACK (expander_callback), NULL);

      // ...
    }
    ```

    # GtkExpander as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkExpander` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface supports
    placing a child in the label position by specifying “label” as the
    “type” attribute of a `<child>` element. A normal content child can be
    specified without specifying a `<child>` type attribute.

    An example of a UI definition fragment with GtkExpander:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkExpander">
      <child type="label">
        <object class="GtkLabel" id="expander-label"/>
      </child>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkEntry" id="expander-content"/>
      </child>
    </object>
    ```

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    expander-widget
    ╰── box
        ├── title
        │   ├── expander
        │   ╰── <label widget>
        ╰── <child>
    ```

    `GtkExpander` has a main node `expander-widget`, and subnode `box` containing
    the title and child widget. The box subnode `title` contains node `expander`,
    i.e. the expand/collapse arrow; then the label widget if any. The arrow of an
    expander that is showing its child gets the `:checked` pseudoclass set on it.

class Expression(object):
    """
    Provides a way to describe references to values.

    An important aspect of expressions is that the value can be obtained
    from a source that is several steps away. For example, an expression
    may describe ‘the value of property A of `object1`, which is itself the
    value of a property of `object2`’. And `object1` may not even exist yet
    at the time that the expression is created. This is contrast to `GObject`
    property bindings, which can only create direct connections between
    the properties of two objects that must both exist for the duration
    of the binding.

    An expression needs to be "evaluated" to obtain the value that it currently
    refers to. An evaluation always happens in the context of a current object
    called `this` (it mirrors the behavior of object-oriented languages),
    which may or may not influence the result of the evaluation. Use
    [method@Gtk.Expression.evaluate] for evaluating an expression.

    Various methods for defining expressions exist, from simple constants via
    [ctor@Gtk.ConstantExpression.new] to looking up properties in a `GObject`
    (even recursively) via [ctor@Gtk.PropertyExpression.new] or providing
    custom functions to transform and combine expressions via
    [ctor@Gtk.ClosureExpression.new].

    Here is an example of a complex expression:

    ```c
      color_expr = gtk_property_expression_new (GTK_TYPE_LIST_ITEM,
                                                NULL, "item");
      expression = gtk_property_expression_new (GTK_TYPE_COLOR,
                                                color_expr, "name");
    ```

    when evaluated with `this` being a `GtkListItem`, it will obtain the
    "item" property from the `GtkListItem`, and then obtain the "name" property
    from the resulting object (which is assumed to be of type `GTK_TYPE_COLOR`).

    A more concise way to describe this would be

    ```
      this->item->name
    ```

    The most likely place where you will encounter expressions is in the context
    of list models and list widgets using them. For example, `GtkDropDown` is
    evaluating a `GtkExpression` to obtain strings from the items in its model
    that it can then use to match against the contents of its search entry.
    `GtkStringFilter` is using a `GtkExpression` for similar reasons.

    By default, expressions are not paying attention to changes and evaluation is
    just a snapshot of the current state at a given time. To get informed about
    changes, an expression needs to be "watched" via a [struct@Gtk.ExpressionWatch],
    which will cause a callback to be called whenever the value of the expression may
    have changed; [method@Gtk.Expression.watch] starts watching an expression, and
    [method@Gtk.ExpressionWatch.unwatch] stops.

    Watches can be created for automatically updating the property of an object,
    similar to GObject's `GBinding` mechanism, by using [method@Gtk.Expression.bind].

    ## GtkExpression in GObject properties

    In order to use a `GtkExpression` as a `GObject` property, you must use the
    [func@Gtk.param_spec_expression] when creating a `GParamSpec` to install in the
    `GObject` class being defined; for instance:

    ```c
    obj_props[PROP_EXPRESSION] =
      gtk_param_spec_expression ("expression",
                                 "Expression",
                                 "The expression used by the widget",
                                 G_PARAM_READWRITE |
                                 G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS |
                                 G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY);
    ```

    When implementing the `GObjectClass.set_property` and `GObjectClass.get_property`
    virtual functions, you must use [func@Gtk.value_get_expression], to retrieve the
    stored `GtkExpression` from the `GValue` container, and [func@Gtk.value_set_expression],
    to store the `GtkExpression` into the `GValue`; for instance:

    ```c
      // in set_property()...
      case PROP_EXPRESSION:
        foo_widget_set_expression (foo, gtk_value_get_expression (value));
        break;

      // in get_property()...
      case PROP_EXPRESSION:
        gtk_value_set_expression (value, foo->expression);
        break;
    ```

    ## GtkExpression in .ui files

    `GtkBuilder` has support for creating expressions. The syntax here can be used where
    a `GtkExpression` object is needed like in a `<property>` tag for an expression
    property, or in a `<binding name="property">` tag to bind a property to an expression.

    To create a property expression, use the `<lookup>` element. It can have a `type`
    attribute to specify the object type, and a `name` attribute to specify the property
    to look up. The content of `<lookup>` can either be a string that specifies the name
    of the object to use, an element specifying an expression to provide an object, or
    empty to use the `this` object.

    Example:

    ```xml
      <lookup name='search'>string_filter</lookup>
    ```

    Since the `<lookup>` element creates an expression and its element content can
    itself be an expression, this means that `<lookup>` tags can also be nested.
    This is a common idiom when dealing with `GtkListItem`s. See
    [class@Gtk.BuilderListItemFactory] for an example of this technique.

    To create a constant expression, use the `<constant>` element. If the type attribute
    is specified, the element content is interpreted as a value of that type. Otherwise,
    it is assumed to be an object. For instance:

    ```xml
      <constant>string_filter</constant>
      <constant type='gchararray'>Hello, world</constant>
    ```

    To create a closure expression, use the `<closure>` element. The `function`
    attribute specifies what function to use for the closure, and the `type`
    attribute specifies its return type. The content of the element contains the
    expressions for the parameters. For instance:

    ```xml
      <closure type='gchararray' function='combine_args_somehow'>
        <constant type='gchararray'>File size:</constant>
        <lookup type='GFile' name='size'>myfile</lookup>
      </closure>
    ```

    To create a property binding, use the `<binding>` element in place of where a
    `<property>` tag would ordinarily be used. The `name` and `object` attributes are
    supported. The `name` attribute is required, and pertains to the applicable property
    name. The `object` attribute is optional. If provided, it will use the specified object
    as the `this` object when the expression is evaluated. Here is an example in which the
    `label` property of a `GtkLabel` is bound to the `string` property of another arbitrary
    object:

    ```xml
      <object class='GtkLabel'>
        <binding name='label'>
          <lookup name='string'>some_other_object</lookup>
        </binding>
      </object>
    ```

class FileChooser(GObject.GInterface):
    """
    `GtkFileChooser` is an interface that can be implemented by file
    selection widgets.

    In GTK, the main objects that implement this interface are
    [class@Gtk.FileChooserWidget] and [class@Gtk.FileChooserDialog].

    You do not need to write an object that implements the `GtkFileChooser`
    interface unless you are trying to adapt an existing file selector to
    expose a standard programming interface.

    `GtkFileChooser` allows for shortcuts to various places in the filesystem.
    In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. It
    may be a bit confusing at first that these shortcuts come from various
    sources and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:

    - Bookmarks: are created by the user, by dragging folders from the
      right pane to the left pane, or by using the “Add”. Bookmarks
      can be renamed and deleted by the user.

    - Shortcuts: can be provided by the application. For example, a Paint
      program may want to add a shortcut for a Clipart folder. Shortcuts
      cannot be modified by the user.

    - Volumes: are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are
      the “roots” of the filesystem.

    # File Names and Encodings

    When the user is finished selecting files in a `GtkFileChooser`, your
    program can get the selected filenames as `GFile`s.

    # Adding options

    You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options
    that are not present in the default design, by using
    [method@Gtk.FileChooser.add_choice]. Each choice has an identifier and
    a user visible label; additionally, each choice can have multiple
    options. If a choice has no option, it will be rendered as a
    check button with the given label; if a choice has options, it will
    be rendered as a combo box.

class FileChooserDialog(Dialog):
    """
    `GtkFileChooserDialog` is a dialog suitable for use with
    “File Open” or “File Save” commands.

    ![An example GtkFileChooserDialog](filechooser.png)

    This widget works by putting a [class@Gtk.FileChooserWidget]
    inside a [class@Gtk.Dialog]. It exposes the [iface@Gtk.FileChooser]
    interface, so you can use all of the [iface@Gtk.FileChooser] functions
    on the file chooser dialog as well as those for [class@Gtk.Dialog].

    Note that `GtkFileChooserDialog` does not have any methods of its
    own. Instead, you should use the functions that work on a
    [iface@Gtk.FileChooser].

    If you want to integrate well with the platform you should use the
    [class@Gtk.FileChooserNative] API, which will use a platform-specific
    dialog if available and fall back to `GtkFileChooserDialog`
    otherwise.

    ## Typical usage

    In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
    `GtkFileChooserDialog` to select a file for opening:

    ```c
    static void
    on_open_response (GtkDialog *dialog,
                      int        response)
    {
      if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
        {
          GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);

          g_autoptr(GFile) file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);

          open_file (file);
        }

      gtk_window_destroy (GTK_WINDOW (dialog));
    }

      // ...
      GtkWidget *dialog;
      GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;

      dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                            parent_window,
                                            action,
                                            _("_Cancel"),
                                            GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                            _("_Open"),
                                            GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                            NULL);

      gtk_window_present (GTK_WINDOW (dialog));

      g_signal_connect (dialog, "response",
                        G_CALLBACK (on_open_response),
                        NULL);
    ```

    To use a dialog for saving, you can use this:

    ```c
    static void
    on_save_response (GtkDialog *dialog,
                      int        response)
    {
      if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
        {
          GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);

          g_autoptr(GFile) file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);

          save_to_file (file);
        }

      gtk_window_destroy (GTK_WINDOW (dialog));
    }

      // ...
      GtkWidget *dialog;
      GtkFileChooser *chooser;
      GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;

      dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Save File",
                                            parent_window,

                        G_CALLBACK (on_save_response),
                        NULL);
    ```

    ## Setting up a file chooser dialog

    There are various cases in which you may need to use a `GtkFileChooserDialog`:

    - To select a file for opening, use %GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN.

    - To save a file for the first time, use %GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE,
      and suggest a name such as “Untitled” with
      [method@Gtk.FileChooser.set_current_name].

    - To save a file under a different name, use %GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE,
      and set the existing file with [method@Gtk.FileChooser.set_file].

    - To choose a folder instead of a filem use %GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SELECT_FOLDER.

    In general, you should only cause the file chooser to show a specific
    folder when it is appropriate to use [method@Gtk.FileChooser.set_file],
    i.e. when you are doing a “Save As” command and you already have a file
    saved somewhere.

    ## Response Codes

    `GtkFileChooserDialog` inherits from [class@Gtk.Dialog], so buttons that
    go in its action area have response codes such as %GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT and
    %GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL. For example, you could call
    [ctor@Gtk.FileChooserDialog.new] as follows:

    ```c
    GtkWidget *dialog;
    GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;

    dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                          parent_window,
                                          action,
                                          _("_Cancel"),
                                          GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                          _("_Open"),
                                          GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                          NULL);
    ```

    This will create buttons for “Cancel” and “Open” that use predefined
    response identifiers from [enum@Gtk.ResponseType].  For most dialog
    boxes you can use your own custom response codes rather than the
    ones in [enum@Gtk.ResponseType], but `GtkFileChooserDialog` assumes that
    its “accept”-type action, e.g. an “Open” or “Save” button,
    will have one of the following response codes:

    - %GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT
    - %GTK_RESPONSE_OK
    - %GTK_RESPONSE_YES
    - %GTK_RESPONSE_APPLY

    This is because `GtkFileChooserDialog` must intercept responses and switch
    to folders if appropriate, rather than letting the dialog terminate — the
    implementation uses these known response codes to know which responses can
    be blocked if appropriate.

    To summarize, make sure you use a predefined response code
    when you use `GtkFileChooserDialog` to ensure proper operation.

    ## CSS nodes

    `GtkFileChooserDialog` has a single CSS node with the name `window` and style
    class `.filechooser`.

        """

class FileChooserNative(NativeDialog):
    """
    `GtkFileChooserNative` is an abstraction of a dialog suitable
    for use with “File Open” or “File Save as” commands.

    By default, this just uses a `GtkFileChooserDialog` to implement
    the actual dialog. However, on some platforms, such as Windows and
    macOS, the native platform file chooser is used instead. When the
    application is running in a sandboxed environment without direct
    filesystem access (such as Flatpak), `GtkFileChooserNative` may call
    the proper APIs (portals) to let the user choose a file and make it
    available to the application.

    While the API of `GtkFileChooserNative` closely mirrors `GtkFileChooserDialog`,
    the main difference is that there is no access to any `GtkWindow` or `GtkWidget`
    for the dialog. This is required, as there may not be one in the case of a
    platform native dialog.

    Showing, hiding and running the dialog is handled by the
    [class@Gtk.NativeDialog] functions.

    Note that unlike `GtkFileChooserDialog`, `GtkFileChooserNative` objects
    are not toplevel widgets, and GTK does not keep them alive. It is your
    responsibility to keep a reference until you are done with the
    object.

    ## Typical usage

    In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
    `GtkFileChooserNative` to select a file for opening:

    ```c
    static void
    on_response (GtkNativeDialog *native,
                 int              response)
    {
      if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
        {
          GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
          GFile *file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);

          open_file (file);

          g_object_unref (file);
        }

      g_object_unref (native);
    }

      // ...
      GtkFileChooserNative *native;
      GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;

      native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Open File",
                                            parent_window,
                                            action,
                                            "_Open",
                                            "_Cancel");

      g_signal_connect (native, "response", G_CALLBACK (on_response), NULL);
      gtk_native_dialog_show (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
    ```

    To use a `GtkFileChooserNative` for saving, you can use this:

    ```c
    static void
    on_response (GtkNativeDialog *native,
                 int              response)
    {
      if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
        {
          GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
          GFile *file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);

          save_to_file (file);

          g_object_unref (file);
        }

      g_object_unref (native);
    }

      // ...
      GtkFileChooserNative *native;
      GtkFileChooser *chooser;
      GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;

      native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Save File",
                                            parent_window,
                                            action,
                                            "_Save",
                                            "_Cancel");
      chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);

      if (user_edited_a_new_document)
        gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, _("Untitled document"));
      else
        gtk_file_chooser_set_file (chooser, existing_file, NULL);

      g_signal_connect (native, "response", G_CALLBACK (on_response), NULL);
      gtk_native_dialog_show (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
    ```

    For more information on how to best set up a file dialog,
    see the [class@Gtk.FileChooserDialog] documentation.

    ## Response Codes

    `GtkFileChooserNative` inherits from [class@Gtk.NativeDialog],
    which means it will return %GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT if the user accepted,
    and %GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL if he pressed cancel. It can also return
    %GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT if the window was unexpectedly closed.

    ## Differences from `GtkFileChooserDialog`

    There are a few things in the [iface@Gtk.FileChooser] interface that
    are not possible to use with `GtkFileChooserNative`, as such use would
    prohibit the use of a native dialog.

    No operations that change the dialog work while the dialog is visible.
    Set all the properties that are required before showing the dialog.

    ## Win32 details

    On windows the `IFileDialog` implementation (added in Windows Vista) is
    used. It supports many of the features that `GtkFileChooser` has, but
    there are some things it does not handle:

    * Any [class@Gtk.FileFilter] added using a mimetype

    If any of these features are used the regular `GtkFileChooserDialog`
    will be used in place of the native one.

    ## Portal details

    When the `org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser` portal is available on
    the session bus, it is used to bring up an out-of-process file chooser.
    Depending on the kind of session the application is running in, this may
    or may not be a GTK file chooser.

    ## macOS details

    On macOS the `NSSavePanel` and `NSOpenPanel` classes are used to provide
    native file chooser dialogs. Some features provided by `GtkFileChooser`
    are not supported:

    * Shortcut folders.

class FileFilter(Filter):

    Filters files by name or mime type.

    `GtkFileFilter` can be used to restrict the files being shown in a
    file chooser. Files can be filtered based on their name (with
    [method@Gtk.FileFilter.add_pattern] or [method@Gtk.FileFilter.add_suffix])
    or on their mime type (with [method@Gtk.FileFilter.add_mime_type]).

    Filtering by mime types handles aliasing and subclassing of mime
    types; e.g. a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime
    type application/rtf, since application/rtf is a subclass of
    text/plain. Note that `GtkFileFilter` allows wildcards for the
    subtype of a mime type, so you can e.g. filter for image/*.

    Normally, file filters are used by adding them to a file chooser
    (see [method@Gtk.FileDialog.set_filters]), but it is also possible to
    manually use a file filter on any [class@Gtk.FilterListModel] containing
    `GFileInfo` objects.

    # GtkFileFilter as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkFileFilter` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface
    supports adding rules using the `<mime-types>` and `<patterns>` and
    `<suffixes>` elements and listing the rules within. Specifying a
    `<mime-type>` or `<pattern>` or `<suffix>` has the same effect as
    as calling
    [method@Gtk.FileFilter.add_mime_type] or
    [method@Gtk.FileFilter.add_pattern] or
    [method@Gtk.FileFilter.add_suffix].

    An example of a UI definition fragment specifying `GtkFileFilter`
    rules:
    ```xml
    <object class="GtkFileFilter">

    Places its child widgets at fixed positions and with fixed sizes.

    `GtkFixed` performs no automatic layout management.

    For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
    you from having to learn about the other GTK containers, but it
    results in broken applications.  With `GtkFixed`, the following
    things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
    other display bugs:

    - Themes, which may change widget sizes.

    - Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
      change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
      users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
      default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different fonts.

    - Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
      display of non-English text will use a different font in many
      cases.

    In addition, `GtkFixed` does not pay attention to text direction and
    thus may produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left
    languages such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK will order
    containers appropriately for the text direction, e.g. to put labels to
    the right of the thing they label when using an RTL language, but it can’t
    do that with `GtkFixed`. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on
    the text direction, you would need to manually detect it and adjust child
    positions accordingly.

    Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
    UI elements, since you have to reposition all the other elements. This
    is a long-term maintenance problem for your application.

    If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,
    and prefer the simplicity of `GtkFixed`, by all means use the
    widget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.

    For instance, with the horizontal orientation, the widgets will be
    arranged from left to right, starting a new row under the previous
    row when necessary. Reducing the width in this case will require more
    rows, so a larger height will be requested.

    Likewise, with the vertical orientation, the widgets will be arranged
    from top to bottom, starting a new column to the right when necessary.
    Reducing the height will require more columns, so a larger width will
    be requested.

    The size request of a `GtkFlowBox` alone may not be what you expect;
    if you need to be able to shrink it along both axes and dynamically
    reflow its children, you may have to wrap it in a `GtkScrolledWindow`
    to enable that.

    The children of a `GtkFlowBox` can be dynamically sorted and filtered.

    Although a `GtkFlowBox` must have only `GtkFlowBoxChild` children, you
    can add any kind of widget to it via [method@Gtk.FlowBox.insert], and a
    `GtkFlowBoxChild` widget will automatically be inserted between the box
    and the widget.

    If present, the label is drawn inside the top edge of the frame.
    The horizontal position of the label can be controlled with

    `GtkFrame` clips its child. You can use this to add rounded corners

    # GtkFrame as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkFrame` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface supports
    placing a child in the label position by specifying “label” as the
    “type” attribute of a `<child>` element. A normal content child can
    be specified without specifying a `<child>` type attribute.

    An example of a UI definition fragment with GtkFrame:
    ```xml
    <object class="GtkFrame">
      <child type="label">
        <object class="GtkLabel" id="frame_label"/>

    frame

    `GtkFrame` has a main CSS node with name “frame”, which is used to draw the
    visible border. You can set the appearance of the border using CSS properties
    like “border-style” on this node.

    Allows drawing with OpenGL.

    </picture>

    `GtkGLArea` sets up its own [class@Gdk.GLContext], and creates a custom
    GL framebuffer that the widget will do GL rendering onto. It also ensures
    that this framebuffer is the default GL rendering target when rendering.
    The completed rendering is integrated into the larger GTK scene graph as
    a texture.

    In order to draw, you have to connect to the [signal@Gtk.GLArea::render]
    signal, or subclass `GtkGLArea` and override the GtkGLAreaClass.render
    virtual function.

    The `GtkGLArea` widget ensures that the `GdkGLContext` is associated with
    the widget's drawing area, and it is kept updated when the size and
    position of the drawing area changes.

    ## Drawing with GtkGLArea

    The simplest way to draw using OpenGL commands in a `GtkGLArea` is to
    create a widget instance and connect to the [signal@Gtk.GLArea::render] signal:

    The `render()` function will be called when the `GtkGLArea` is ready
    for you to draw its content:

    The initial contents of the framebuffer are transparent.

    ```c
    static gboolean
    render (GtkGLArea *area, GdkGLContext *context)
    {
      // inside this function it's safe to use GL; the given
      // GdkGLContext has been made current to the drawable
      // surface used by the `GtkGLArea` and the viewport has
      // already been set to be the size of the allocation

      // we can start by clearing the buffer
      glClearColor (0, 0, 0, 0);
      glClear (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

      // record the active framebuffer ID, so we can return to it
      // with `glBindFramebuffer (GL_FRAMEBUFFER, screen_fb)` should
      // we, for instance, intend on utilizing the results of an
      // intermediate render texture pass
      GLuint screen_fb = 0;
      glGetIntegerv (GL_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING, &screen_fb);

      // draw your object
      // draw_an_object ();

      // we completed our drawing; the draw commands will be
      // flushed at the end of the signal emission chain, and
      // the buffers will be drawn on the window
      return TRUE;
    }

    void setup_glarea (void)
    {
      // create a GtkGLArea instance
      GtkWidget *gl_area = gtk_gl_area_new ();

      // connect to the "render" signal
      g_signal_connect (gl_area, "render", G_CALLBACK (render), NULL);
    }
    ```

    If you need to initialize OpenGL state, e.g. buffer objects or
    shaders, you should use the [signal@Gtk.Widget::realize] signal;
    you can use the [signal@Gtk.Widget::unrealize] signal to clean up.
    Since the `GdkGLContext` creation and initialization may fail, you
    will need to check for errors, using [method@Gtk.GLArea.get_error].

    An example of how to safely initialize the GL state is:

    ```c
    static void
    on_realize (GtkGLArea *area)
    {
      // We need to make the context current if we want to
      // call GL API
      gtk_gl_area_make_current (area);

      // If there were errors during the initialization or
      // when trying to make the context current, this
      // function will return a GError for you to catch
      if (gtk_gl_area_get_error (area) != NULL)
        return;

      // You can also use gtk_gl_area_set_error() in order

class Gesture(EventController):

    The base class for gesture recognition.

    Although `GtkGesture` is quite generalized to serve as a base for
    multi-touch gestures, it is suitable to implement single-touch and
    pointer-based gestures (using the special %NULL `GdkEventSequence`
    value for these).

    The number of touches that a `GtkGesture` need to be recognized is
    controlled by the [property@Gtk.Gesture:n-points] property, if a
    gesture is keeping track of less or more than that number of sequences,
    it won't check whether the gesture is recognized.

    As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, it will check
    regularly if it is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as
    "recognized" is left to `GtkGesture` subclasses.

    A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:

    - [signal@Gtk.Gesture::begin] when the gesture is recognized.
    - [signal@Gtk.Gesture::update], whenever an input event is processed.
    - [signal@Gtk.Gesture::end] when the gesture is no longer recognized.

    ## Event propagation

    In order to receive events, a gesture needs to set a propagation phase
    through [method@Gtk.EventController.set_propagation_phase].

    In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down
    to the target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers
    above the widget get a chance to interact with the event before it
    reaches the target.

    In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget
    to the toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above
    the widget get a chance to interact with events that have not been
    handled yet.

    ## States of a sequence

    Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade
    of `GtkGesture`s, both across the parents of the widget receiving the
    event and in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility
    of the widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences
    accordingly in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the
    `GdkEventSequence`s triggering those.

    Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through [method@Gtk.Gesture.group].
    Grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
    [method@Gtk.Gesture.set_state] on one will effectively propagate
    the state throughout the group.

    By default, all sequences start out in the %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_NONE state,
    sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
    propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.

    If a sequence enters into the %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED state, the gesture
    group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
    through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
    the touch is active.

    If a sequence enters in the %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED state, the gesture
    group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:

    - Setting the same sequence to %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED on every other
      gesture group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets
      in the propagation chain.
    - Emitting [signal@Gtk.Gesture::cancel] on every gesture in widgets
      underneath in the propagation chain.
    - Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.

    Note: if a sequence is set early to %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED on
    %GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN/%GDK_BUTTON_PRESS (so those events are captured before
    reaching the event widget, this implies %GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE), one similar
    event will be emulated if the sequence changes to %GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED.
    This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
    again.

    Sequence states can't be changed freely.
    See [method@Gtk.Gesture.set_state] to know about the possible
    lifetimes of a `GdkEventSequence`.

    ## Touchpad gestures

    On the platforms that support it, `GtkGesture` will handle transparently
    touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of `GtkGesture` should
    do to enable this support are:

    - If the gesture has %GTK_PHASE_NONE, ensuring events of type
      %GDK_TOUCHPAD_SWIPE and %GDK_TOUCHPAD_PINCH are handled by the `GtkGesture`

    Bypasses gsk rendering by passing the content of its child directly to the compositor.

    Graphics offload is an optimization to reduce overhead and battery use that is
    most useful for video content. It only works on some platforms and in certain
    situations. GTK will automatically fall back to normal rendering if it doesn't.

    Graphics offload is most efficient if there are no controls drawn on top of the
    video content.

    You should consider using graphics offload for your main widget if it shows
    frequently changing content (such as a video, or a VM display) and you provide
    the content in the form of dmabuf textures (see [class@Gdk.DmabufTextureBuilder]),
    in particular if it may be fullscreen.

    Numerous factors can prohibit graphics offload:

    - Unsupported platforms. Currently, graphics offload only works on Linux with Wayland.

    - Clipping, such as rounded corners that cause the video content to not be rectangular

    - Unsupported dmabuf formats (see [method@Gdk.Display.get_dmabuf_formats])

    - Translucent video content (content with an alpha channel, even if it isn't used)

    - Transforms that are more complex than translations and scales

    - Filters such as opacity, grayscale or similar

    To investigate problems related graphics offload, GTK offers debug flags to print
    out information about graphics offload and dmabuf use:

        GDK_DEBUG=offload
        GDK_DEBUG=dmabuf

    The GTK inspector provides a visual debugging tool for graphics offload.

    Every child in a `GtkGrid` has access to a custom [iface@Gtk.Buildable]
    element, called `<layout>`. It can by used to specify a position in the
    grid and optionally spans. All properties that can be used in the `<layout>`
    element are implemented by [class@Gtk.GridLayoutChild].

    It is implemented by `GtkWidget` using [class@Gtk.LayoutManager].

    To showcase it, here is a simple example:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkGrid" id="my_grid">
      <child>
        <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
          <property name="label">Button 1</property>
          <layout>
            <property name="column">0</property>
            <property name="row">0</property>
          </layout>
        </object>
      </child>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkButton" id="button2">
          <property name="label">Button 2</property>
          <layout>
            <property name="column">1</property>
            <property name="row">0</property>
          </layout>
        </object>
      </child>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkButton" id="button3">
          <property name="label">Button 3</property>
          <layout>
            <property name="column">2</property>
            <property name="row">0</property>
            <property name="row-span">2</property>
          </layout>
        </object>
      </child>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkButton" id="button4">
          <property name="label">Button 4</property>
          <layout>
            <property name="column">0</property>
            <property name="row">1</property>
            <property name="column-span">2</property>
          </layout>
        </object>
      </child>
    </object>
    ```

    It organizes the first two buttons side-by-side in one cell each.
    The third button is in the last column but spans across two rows.
    This is defined by the `row-span` property. The last button is
    located in the second row and spans across two columns, which is
    defined by the `column-span` property.

    # CSS nodes

    `GtkGrid` uses a single CSS node with name `grid`.

    # Accessibility

    Until GTK 4.10, `GtkGrid` used the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.group] role.

    Starting from GTK 4.12, `GtkGrid` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.generic] role.

    Presents a large dynamic grid of items.

    `GtkGridView` uses its factory to generate one child widget for each
    visible item and shows them in a grid. The orientation of the grid view
    determines if the grid reflows vertically or horizontally.

    `GtkGridView` allows the user to select items according to the selection
    characteristics of the model. For models that allow multiple selected items,
    it is possible to turn on _rubberband selection_, using
    [property@Gtk.GridView:enable-rubberband].

    To learn more about the list widget framework, see the
    [overview](section-list-widget.html).

    # Actions

    `GtkGridView` defines a set of built-in actions:

    - `list.activate-item` activates the item at given position by emitting the
      the [signal@Gtk.GridView::activate] signal.

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    gridview
    ├── child[.activatable]
    │
    ├── child[.activatable]
    │
    ┊
    ╰── [rubberband]
    ```

    `GtkGridView` uses a single CSS node with name `gridview`. Each child uses
    a single CSS node with name `child`. If the [property@Gtk.ListItem:activatable]
    property is set, the corresponding row will have the `.activatable` style
    class. For rubberband selection, a subnode with name `rubberband` is used.

    # Accessibility

    `GtkGridView` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.grid] role, and the items
    use the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.grid_cell] role.

    `GtkHeaderBar` is similar to a horizontal `GtkCenterBox`. It allows
    children to be placed at the start or the end. In addition, it allows
    the window title to be displayed. The title will be centered with respect
    to the width of the box, even if the children at either side take up
    different amounts of space.

    `GtkHeaderBar` can add typical window frame controls, such as minimize,
    maximize and close buttons, or the window icon.

    For these reasons, `GtkHeaderBar` is the natural choice for use as the
    custom titlebar widget of a `GtkWindow` (see [method@Gtk.Window.set_titlebar]),
    as it gives features typical of titlebars while allowing the addition of
    child widgets.

    ## GtkHeaderBar as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkHeaderBar` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface supports
    adding children at the start or end sides by specifying “start” or “end” as
    the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element, or setting the title widget by
    specifying “title” value.

    By default the `GtkHeaderBar` uses a `GtkLabel` displaying the title of the
    window it is contained in as the title widget, equivalent to the following
    UI definition:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkHeaderBar">
      <property name="title-widget">
        <object class="GtkLabel">
          <property name="label" translatable="yes">Label</property>
          <property name="single-line-mode">True</property>
          <property name="ellipsize">end</property>
          <property name="width-chars">5</property>
          <style>
            <class name="title"/>
          </style>
        </object>
      </property>
    </object>
    ```

    A `GtkHeaderBar`'s CSS node is called `headerbar`. It contains a `windowhandle`
    subnode, which contains a `box` subnode, which contains two `box` subnodes at
    the start and end of the header bar, as well as a center node that represents
    the title.

    Each of the boxes contains a `windowcontrols` subnode, see
    [class@Gtk.WindowControls] for details, as well as other children.

    For instance, the built-in GTK input method [class@Gtk.IMContextSimple]
    implements the input of arbitrary Unicode code points by holding down the
    <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys and then typing <kbd>u</kbd>
    followed by the hexadecimal digits of the code point. When releasing the
    <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys, preediting ends and the
    character is inserted as text. For example,

        Ctrl+Shift+u 2 0 A C

    results in the € sign.

    Additional input methods can be made available for use by GTK widgets as
    loadable modules. An input method module is a small shared library which
    provides a `GIOExtension` for the extension point named "gtk-im-module".

    To connect a widget to the users preferred input method, you should use
    [class@Gtk.IMMulticontext].

    Supports compose sequences, dead keys and numeric Unicode input.

    ## Compose sequences

    `GtkIMContextSimple` reads compose sequences from the first of the
    following files that is found: ~/.config/gtk-4.0/Compose, ~/.XCompose,
    /usr/share/X11/locale/$locale/Compose (for locales that have a nontrivial
    Compose file). A subset of the file syntax described in the Compose(5)
    manual page is supported. Additionally, `include "%L"` loads GTK’s built-in
    table of compose sequences rather than the locale-specific one from X11.

    If none of these files is found, `GtkIMContextSimple` uses a built-in table
    of compose sequences that is derived from the X11 Compose files.

    Note that compose sequences typically start with the Compose_key, which is
    often not available as a dedicated key on keyboards. Keyboard layouts may
    map this keysym to other keys, such as the right Control key.

    ## Unicode characters

    `GtkIMContextSimple` also supports numeric entry of Unicode characters
    by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>u</kbd>, followed by a
    hexadecimal Unicode codepoint.

    For example,

        Ctrl-Shift-u 1 2 3 Enter

    yields U+0123 LATIN SMALL LETTER G WITH CEDILLA, i.e. ģ.

    ## Dead keys

    `GtkIMContextSimple` supports dead keys. For example, typing

        dead_acute a

     yields U+00E! LATIN SMALL LETTER_A WITH ACUTE, i.e. á. Note that this
     depends on the keyboard layout including dead keys.

    Loads themed icons.

    The main reason for using a name rather than simply providing a filename

    selected by the user. The operation of icon themes on Linux and Unix
    follows the [Icon Theme Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec)
    There is a fallback icon theme, named `hicolor`, where applications
    should install their icons, but additional icon themes can be installed
    as operating system vendors and users choose.

    In many cases, named themes are used indirectly, via [class@Gtk.Image]
    rather than directly, but looking up icons directly is also simple. The
    `GtkIconTheme` object acts as a database of all the icons in the current
    theme. You can create new `GtkIconTheme` objects, but it’s much more
    efficient to use the standard icon theme of the `GtkWidget` so that the
    icon information is shared with other people looking up icons.

    GtkIconTheme *icon_theme;
    GtkIconPaintable *icon;

      <source srcset="image-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An example GtkImage" src="image.png">
    </picture>

    Various kinds of object can be displayed as an image; most typically,
    you would load a `GdkTexture` from a file, using the convenience function
    [ctor@Gtk.Image.new_from_file], for instance:

    ```c
    GtkWidget *image = gtk_image_new_from_file ("myfile.png");
    ```

    If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the image will contain a
    “broken image” icon similar to that used in many web browsers.

    If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
    for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
    [ctor@Gdk.Texture.new_from_file], then create the `GtkImage` with
    [ctor@Gtk.Image.new_from_paintable].

    Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data
    files, such as image files. See the documentation of `GResource` inside
    GIO, for details. In this case, [property@Gtk.Image:resource],
    [ctor@Gtk.Image.new_from_resource], and [method@Gtk.Image.set_from_resource]
    should be used.

    `GtkImage` displays its image as an icon, with a size that is determined
    by the application. See [class@Gtk.Picture] if you want to show an image
    at is actual size.

    ## CSS nodes

    `GtkImage` has a single CSS node with the name `image`. The style classes
    `.normal-icons` or `.large-icons` may appear, depending on the
    [property@Gtk.Image:icon-size] property.

    ## Accessibility

    `GtkImage` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.img] role.

    `GtkInfoBar` can be used to show messages to the user without a dialog.

    It is often temporarily shown at the top or bottom of a document.
    In contrast to [class@Gtk.Dialog], which has an action area at the
    bottom, `GtkInfoBar` has an action area at the side.

    The API of `GtkInfoBar` is very similar to `GtkDialog`, allowing you
    to add buttons to the action area with [method@Gtk.InfoBar.add_button]
    or [ctor@Gtk.InfoBar.new_with_buttons]. The sensitivity of action widgets
    can be controlled with [method@Gtk.InfoBar.set_response_sensitive].

    To add widgets to the main content area of a `GtkInfoBar`, use
    [method@Gtk.InfoBar.add_child].

    Similar to [class@Gtk.MessageDialog], the contents of a `GtkInfoBar`
    can by classified as error message, warning, informational message, etc,
    by using [method@Gtk.InfoBar.set_message_type]. GTK may use the message
    type to determine how the message is displayed.

    A simple example for using a `GtkInfoBar`:
    ```c
    GtkWidget *message_label;
    GtkWidget *widget;
    GtkWidget *grid;
    GtkInfoBar *bar;

    // set up info bar
    widget = gtk_info_bar_new ();
    bar = GTK_INFO_BAR (widget);
    grid = gtk_grid_new ();

    message_label = gtk_label_new ("");
    gtk_info_bar_add_child (bar, message_label);
    gtk_info_bar_add_button (bar,
                             _("_OK"),
                             GTK_RESPONSE_OK);
    g_signal_connect (bar,
                      "response",
                      G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_hide),
                      NULL);
    gtk_grid_attach (GTK_GRID (grid),
                     widget,
                     0, 2, 1, 1);

    // ...

    // show an error message
    gtk_label_set_text (GTK_LABEL (message_label), "An error occurred!");
    gtk_info_bar_set_message_type (bar, GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR);
    gtk_widget_show (bar);
    ```

    # GtkInfoBar as GtkBuildable

    `GtkInfoBar` supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
    multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
    numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
    (which should be a child of the dialogs @action_area).

    `GtkInfoBar` supports adding action widgets by specifying “action” as
    the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element. The widget will be added
    either to the action area. The response id has to be associated
    with the action widget using the `<action-widgets>` element.

    # CSS nodes

    `GtkInfoBar` has a single CSS node with name infobar. The node may get
    one of the style classes .info, .warning, .error or .question, depending
    on the message type.
    If the info bar shows a close button, that button will have the .close
    style class applied.

    ## Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkLabel` supports the following keyboard shortcuts, when the cursor is
    visible:

    - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> or <kbd>Menu</kbd> opens the context menu.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&sol;</kbd>
      selects all.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> or
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&bsol;</kbd> unselects all.

    Additionally, the following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.Label::activate-current-link]
    - [signal@Gtk.Label::copy-clipboard]
    - [signal@Gtk.Label::move-cursor]

    ## Actions

    `GtkLabel` defines a set of built-in actions:

    - `clipboard.copy` copies the text to the clipboard.
    - `clipboard.cut` doesn't do anything, since text in labels can't be deleted.
    - `clipboard.paste` doesn't do anything, since text in labels can't be
      edited.
    - `link.open` opens the link, when activated on a link inside the label.
    - `link.copy` copies the link to the clipboard, when activated on a link
      inside the label.
    - `menu.popup` opens the context menu.
    - `selection.delete` doesn't do anything, since text in labels can't be
      deleted.
    - `selection.select-all` selects all of the text, if the label allows
      selection.

    ## CSS nodes

    ```
    label
    ├── [selection]
    ├── [link]
    ┊
    ╰── [link]
    ```

    `GtkLabel` has a single CSS node with the name label. A wide variety
    of style classes may be applied to labels, such as .title, .subtitle,
    .dim-label, etc. In the `GtkShortcutsWindow`, labels are used with the
    .keycap style class.

    If the label has a selection, it gets a subnode with name selection.

    If the label has links, there is one subnode per link. These subnodes
    carry the link or visited state depending on whether they have been
    visited. In this case, label node also gets a .link style class.

    ## GtkLabel as GtkBuildable

    The GtkLabel implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports a
    custom `<attributes>` element, which supports any number of `<attribute>`
    elements. The `<attribute>` element has attributes named “name“, “value“,
    “start“ and “end“ and allows you to specify [struct@Pango.Attribute]
    values for this label.

    An example of a UI definition fragment specifying Pango attributes:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkLabel">
      <attributes>
        <attribute name="weight" value="PANGO_WEIGHT_BOLD"/>
        <attribute name="background" value="red" start="5" end="10"/>
      </attributes>
    </object>
    ```

    The start and end attributes specify the range of characters to which the
    Pango attribute applies. If start and end are not specified, the attribute is
    applied to the whole text. Note that specifying ranges does not make much
    sense with translatable attributes. Use markup embedded in the translatable
    content instead.

    ## Accessibility

    `GtkLabel` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.label] role.

    ## Mnemonics

    Labels may contain “mnemonics”. Mnemonics are underlined characters in the
    label, used for keyboard navigation. Mnemonics are created by providing a
    string with an underscore before the mnemonic character, such as `"_File"`,
    to the functions [ctor@Gtk.Label.new_with_mnemonic] or
    [method@Gtk.Label.set_text_with_mnemonic].

    Mnemonics automatically activate any activatable widget the label is
    inside, such as a [class@Gtk.Button]; if the label is not inside the
    mnemonic’s target widget, you have to tell the label about the target
    using [method@Gtk.Label.set_mnemonic_widget].

    Here’s a simple example where the label is inside a button:

    ```c
    // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
    GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new ();
    GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
    gtk_button_set_child (GTK_BUTTON (button), label);
    ```

    There’s a convenience function to create buttons with a mnemonic label
    already inside:

    ```c
    // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
    GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
    ```

    To create a mnemonic for a widget alongside the label, such as a
    [class@Gtk.Entry], you have to point the label at the entry with
    [method@Gtk.Label.set_mnemonic_widget]:

    ```c
    // Pressing Alt+H will focus the entry
    GtkWidget *entry = gtk_entry_new ();
    GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
    gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget (GTK_LABEL (label), entry);
    ```

    ## Markup (styled text)

    To make it easy to format text in a label (changing colors, fonts, etc.),
    label text can be provided in a simple markup format:

    Here’s how to create a label with a small font:
    ```c
    GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
    gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), "<small>Small text</small>");
    ```

    (See the Pango manual for complete documentation] of available
    tags, [func@Pango.parse_markup])

    The markup passed to [method@Gtk.Label.set_markup] must be valid XML; for example,
    literal `<`, `>` and `&` characters must be escaped as `&lt;`, `&gt;`, and `&amp;`.
    If you pass text obtained from the user, file, or a network to
    [method@Gtk.Label.set_markup], you’ll want to escape it with
    [func@GLib.markup_escape_text] or [func@GLib.markup_printf_escaped].

    Markup strings are just a convenient way to set the [struct@Pango.AttrList]
    on a label; [method@Gtk.Label.set_attributes] may be a simpler way to set
    attributes in some cases. Be careful though; [struct@Pango.AttrList] tends
    to cause internationalization problems, unless you’re applying attributes
    to the entire string (i.e. unless you set the range of each attribute
    to [0, `G_MAXINT`)). The reason is that specifying the `start_index` and
    `end_index` for a [struct@Pango.Attribute] requires knowledge of the exact
    string being displayed, so translations will cause problems.

    ## Selectable labels

    Labels can be made selectable with [method@Gtk.Label.set_selectable].
    Selectable labels allow the user to copy the label contents to the
    clipboard. Only labels that contain useful-to-copy information — such
    as error messages — should be made selectable.

    ## Text layout

    A label can contain any number of paragraphs, but will have
    performance problems if it contains more than a small number.
    Paragraphs are separated by newlines or other paragraph separators
    understood by Pango.

    Labels can automatically wrap text if you call [method@Gtk.Label.set_wrap].

    [method@Gtk.Label.set_justify] sets how the lines in a label align
    with one another. If you want to set how the label as a whole aligns
    in its available space, see the [property@Gtk.Widget:halign] and
    [property@Gtk.Widget:valign] properties.

    The [property@Gtk.Label:width-chars] and [property@Gtk.Label:max-width-chars]
    properties can be used to control the size allocation of ellipsized or
    wrapped labels. For ellipsizing labels, if either is specified (and less
    than the actual text size), it is used as the minimum width, and the actual
    text size is used as the natural width of the label. For wrapping labels,
    width-chars is used as the minimum width, if specified, and max-width-chars
    is used as the natural width. Even if max-width-chars specified, wrapping
    labels will be rewrapped to use all of the available width.

    ## Links

    GTK supports markup for clickable hyperlinks in addition to regular Pango
    markup. The markup for links is borrowed from HTML, using the `<a>` tag
    with “href“, “title“ and “class“ attributes. GTK renders links similar to
    the way they appear in web browsers, with colored, underlined text. The
    “title“ attribute is displayed as a tooltip on the link. The “class“
    attribute is used as style class on the CSS node for the link.

    An example of inline links looks like this:

    ```c
    const char *text =
    "Go to the "
    "<a href="https://www.gtk.org" title="&lt;i&gt;Our&lt;/i&gt; website">"
    "GTK website</a> for more...";
    GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
    gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), text);
    ```

    It is possible to implement custom handling for links and their tooltips
    with the [signal@Gtk.Label::activate-link] signal and the
    [method@Gtk.Label.get_current_uri] function.

    Handles the preferred size and allocation for children of a widget.

    You typically subclass `GtkLayoutManager` if you want to implement a
    layout policy for the children of a widget, or if you want to determine
    the size of a widget depending on its contents.

    Each `GtkWidget` can only have a `GtkLayoutManager` instance associated
    to it at any given time; it is possible, though, to replace the layout
    manager instance using [method@Gtk.Widget.set_layout_manager].

    ## Layout properties

    A layout manager can expose properties for controlling the layout of
    each child, by creating an object type derived from [class@Gtk.LayoutChild]
    and installing the properties on it as normal `GObject` properties.

    Each `GtkLayoutChild` instance storing the layout properties for a
    specific child is created through the [method@Gtk.LayoutManager.get_layout_child]
    method; a `GtkLayoutManager` controls the creation of its `GtkLayoutChild`
    instances by overriding the GtkLayoutManagerClass.create_layout_child()
    virtual function. The typical implementation should look like:

    ```c
    static GtkLayoutChild *
    create_layout_child (GtkLayoutManager *manager,
                         GtkWidget        *container,
                         GtkWidget        *child)
    {
      return g_object_new (your_layout_child_get_type (),
                           "layout-manager", manager,
                           "child-widget", child,
                           NULL);
    }
    ```

    The [property@Gtk.LayoutChild:layout-manager] and
    [property@Gtk.LayoutChild:child-widget] properties
    on the newly created `GtkLayoutChild` instance are mandatory. The
    `GtkLayoutManager` will cache the newly created `GtkLayoutChild` instance
    until the widget is removed from its parent, or the parent removes the
    layout manager.

    Each `GtkLayoutManager` instance creating a `GtkLayoutChild` should use
    [method@Gtk.LayoutManager.get_layout_child] every time it needs to query
    the layout properties; each `GtkLayoutChild` instance should call
    [method@Gtk.LayoutManager.layout_changed] every time a property is
    updated, in order to queue a new size measuring and allocation.

    Use [method@Gtk.LevelBar.set_value] to set the current value, and
    [method@Gtk.LevelBar.add_offset_value] to set the value offsets at which
    the bar will be considered in a different state. GTK will add a few
    offsets by default on the level bar: %GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_LOW,
    %GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_HIGH and %GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_FULL, with
    values 0.25, 0.75 and 1.0 respectively.

    Note that it is your responsibility to update preexisting offsets
    when changing the minimum or maximum value. GTK will simply clamp
    them to the new range.

    ## Adding a custom offset on the bar

    ```c
    static GtkWidget *
    create_level_bar (void)
    {
      GtkWidget *widget;
      GtkLevelBar *bar;

      widget = gtk_level_bar_new ();
      bar = GTK_LEVEL_BAR (widget);

      // This changes the value of the default low offset

      gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value (bar,
                                      GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_LOW,
                                      0.10);

      // This adds a new offset to the bar; the application will
      // be able to change its color CSS like this:
      //
      // levelbar block.my-offset {
      //   background-color: magenta;
      //   border-style: solid;
      //   border-color: black;
      //   border-width: 1px;
      // }

      gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value (bar, "my-offset", 0.60);

      return widget;
    }
    ```

    The default interval of values is between zero and one, but it’s possible
    to modify the interval using [method@Gtk.LevelBar.set_min_value] and
    [method@Gtk.LevelBar.set_max_value]. The value will be always drawn in
    proportion to the admissible interval, i.e. a value of 15 with a specified
    interval between 10 and 20 is equivalent to a value of 0.5 with an interval
    between 0 and 1. When %GTK_LEVEL_BAR_MODE_DISCRETE is used, the bar level
    is rendered as a finite number of separated blocks instead of a single one.
    The number of blocks that will be rendered is equal to the number of units
    specified by the admissible interval.

    For instance, to build a bar rendered with five blocks, it’s sufficient to
    set the minimum value to 0 and the maximum value to 5 after changing the
    indicator mode to discrete.

    # GtkLevelBar as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkLevelBar` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface supports a
    custom `<offsets>` element, which can contain any number of `<offset>` elements,
    each of which must have "name" and "value" attributes.

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    levelbar[.discrete]
    ╰── trough
        ├── block.filled.level-name
        ┊
        ├── block.empty
        ┊
    ```

    `GtkLevelBar` has a main CSS node with name levelbar and one of the style
    classes .discrete or .continuous and a subnode with name trough. Below the
    trough node are a number of nodes with name block and style class .filled
    or .empty. In continuous mode, there is exactly one node of each, in discrete
    mode, the number of filled and unfilled nodes corresponds to blocks that are
    drawn. The block.filled nodes also get a style class .level-name corresponding
    to the level for the current value.

    In horizontal orientation, the nodes are always arranged from left to right,
    regardless of text direction.

    It is useful to show quick links to resources.

    A link button is created by calling either [ctor@Gtk.LinkButton.new] or
    [ctor@Gtk.LinkButton.new_with_label]. If using the former, the URI you
    pass to the constructor is used as a label for the widget.

    The URI bound to a `GtkLinkButton` can be set specifically using
    [method@Gtk.LinkButton.set_uri].

    By default, `GtkLinkButton` calls [method@Gtk.FileLauncher.launch] when the button
    is clicked. This behaviour can be overridden by connecting to the
    [signal@Gtk.LinkButton::activate-link] signal and returning %TRUE from
    the signal handler.

    A `GtkListBox` only contains `GtkListBoxRow` children. These rows can
    by dynamically sorted and filtered, and headers can be added dynamically
    depending on the row content. It also allows keyboard and mouse navigation
    and selection like a typical list.

    Using `GtkListBox` is often an alternative to `GtkTreeView`, especially
    when the list contents has a more complicated layout than what is allowed
    by a `GtkCellRenderer`, or when the contents is interactive (i.e. has a
    button in it).

    Although a `GtkListBox` must have only `GtkListBoxRow` children, you can
    add any kind of widget to it via [method@Gtk.ListBox.prepend],
    [method@Gtk.ListBox.append] and [method@Gtk.ListBox.insert] and a
    `GtkListBoxRow` widget will automatically be inserted between the list
    and the widget.

    `GtkListBoxRows` can be marked as activatable or selectable. If a row is
    activatable, [signal@Gtk.ListBox::row-activated] will be emitted for it when
    the user tries to activate it. If it is selectable, the row will be marked
    as selected when the user tries to select it.

    # GtkListBox as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkListBox` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface supports
    setting a child as the placeholder by specifying “placeholder” as the “type”
    attribute of a `<child>` element. See [method@Gtk.ListBox.set_placeholder]
    for info.

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    The following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.ListBox::move-cursor]
    - [signal@Gtk.ListBox::select-all]
    - [signal@Gtk.ListBox::toggle-cursor-row]
    - [signal@Gtk.ListBox::unselect-all]

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    list[.separators][.rich-list][.navigation-sidebar][.boxed-list]
    ╰── row[.activatable]
    ```

    `GtkListBox` uses a single CSS node named list. It may carry the .separators
    style class, when the [property@Gtk.ListBox:show-separators] property is set.
    Each `GtkListBoxRow` uses a single CSS node named row. The row nodes get the
    .activatable style class added when appropriate.

    It may also carry the .boxed-list style class. In this case, the list will be
    automatically surrounded by a frame and have separators.

    The main list node may also carry style classes to select
    the style of [list presentation](section-list-widget.html#list-styles):
    .rich-list, .navigation-sidebar or .data-table.

class ListItemFactory(GObject.Object):

    Creates widgets for the items taken from a `GListModel`.

    This is one of the core concepts of handling list widgets such
    as [class@Gtk.ListView] or [class@Gtk.GridView].

    The `GtkListItemFactory` is tasked with creating widgets for items
    taken from the model when the views need them and updating them as
    the items displayed by the view change.

    A view is usually only able to display anything after both a factory
    and a model have been set on the view. So it is important that you do
    not skip this step when setting up your first view.

    Because views do not display the whole list at once but only a few
    items, they only need to maintain a few widgets at a time. They will
    instruct the `GtkListItemFactory` to create these widgets and bind them
    to the items that are currently displayed.

    As the list model changes or the user scrolls to the list, the items will
    change and the view will instruct the factory to bind the widgets to those
    new items.

    The actual widgets used for displaying those widgets is provided by you.

    When the factory needs widgets created, it will create a `GtkListItem`
    and hand it to your code to set up a widget for. This list item will provide
    various properties with information about what item to display and provide
    you with some opportunities to configure its behavior. See the
    [class@Gtk.ListItem] documentation for further details.

    Various implementations of `GtkListItemFactory` exist to allow you different
    ways to provide those widgets. The most common implementations are
    [class@Gtk.BuilderListItemFactory] which takes a `GtkBuilder` .ui file
    and then creates widgets and manages everything automatically from the
    information in that file and [class@Gtk.SignalListItemFactory] which allows
    you to connect to signals with your own code and retain full control over
    how the widgets are setup and managed.

    A `GtkListItemFactory` is supposed to be final - that means its behavior should
    not change and the first widget created from it should behave the same way as
    the last widget created from it.
    If you intend to do changes to the behavior, it is recommended that you create
    a new `GtkListItemFactory` which will allow the views to recreate its widgets.

    Once you have chosen your factory and created it, you need to set it on the view
    widget you want to use it with, such as via [method@Gtk.ListView.set_factory].
    Reusing factories across different views is allowed, but very uncommon.

class ListStore(GObject.Object):
    """
    A list-like data structure that can be used with the [class@Gtk.TreeView].

    The `GtkListStore` object is a list model for use with a `GtkTreeView`
    widget.  It implements the `GtkTreeModel` interface, and consequentialy,
    can use all of the methods available there.  It also implements the
    `GtkTreeSortable` interface so it can be sorted by the view.
    Finally, it also implements the tree
    [drag](iface.TreeDragSource.html) and [drop](iface.TreeDragDest.html)
    interfaces.

    The `GtkListStore` can accept most `GType`s as a column type, though
    it can’t accept all custom types.  Internally, it will keep a copy of
    data passed in (such as a string or a boxed pointer).  Columns that
    accept `GObject`s are handled a little differently.  The
    `GtkListStore` will keep a reference to the object instead of copying the
    value.  As a result, if the object is modified, it is up to the
    application writer to call [method@Gtk.TreeModel.row_changed] to emit the
    [signal@Gtk.TreeModel::row_changed] signal. This most commonly affects lists
    with [class@Gdk.Texture]s stored.

    An example for creating a simple list store:

    ```c
    enum {
      COLUMN_STRING,
      COLUMN_INT,
      COLUMN_BOOLEAN,
      N_COLUMNS
    };

    {
      GtkListStore *list_store;
      GtkTreePath *path;
      GtkTreeIter iter;
      int i;

      list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                       G_TYPE_STRING,
                                       G_TYPE_INT,
                                       G_TYPE_BOOLEAN);

      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
          char *some_data;

          some_data = get_some_data (i);

          // Add a new row to the model
          gtk_list_store_append (list_store, &iter);
          gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
                              COLUMN_STRING, some_data,
                              COLUMN_INT, i,
                              COLUMN_BOOLEAN,  FALSE,
                              -1);

          // As the store will keep a copy of the string internally,
          // we free some_data.
          g_free (some_data);
        }

      // Modify a particular row
      path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("4");
      gtk_tree_model_get_iter (GTK_TREE_MODEL (list_store),
                               &iter,
                               path);
      gtk_tree_path_free (path);
      gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
                          COLUMN_BOOLEAN, TRUE,
                          -1);
    }
    ```

    `GtkListStore` is deprecated since GTK 4.10, and should not be used in newly
    written code. You should use [class@Gio.ListStore] instead, and the various
    list models provided by GTK.

    ## Performance Considerations

    Internally, the `GtkListStore` was originally implemented with a linked list
    with a tail pointer.  As a result, it was fast at data insertion and deletion,
    and not fast at random data access.  The `GtkListStore` sets the
    `GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST` flag, which means that `GtkTreeIter`s can be
    cached while the row exists.  Thus, if access to a particular row is needed
    often and your code is expected to run on older versions of GTK, it is worth
    keeping the iter around.

    ## Atomic Operations

    It is important to note that only the methods
    gtk_list_store_insert_with_values() and gtk_list_store_insert_with_valuesv()
    are atomic, in the sense that the row is being appended to the store and the
    values filled in in a single operation with regard to `GtkTreeModel` signaling.
    In contrast, using e.g. gtk_list_store_append() and then gtk_list_store_set()
    will first create a row, which triggers the `GtkTreeModel::row-inserted` signal
    on `GtkListStore`. The row, however, is still empty, and any signal handler
    connecting to `GtkTreeModel::row-inserted` on this particular store should be prepared
    for the situation that the row might be empty. This is especially important
    if you are wrapping the `GtkListStore` inside a `GtkTreeModel`Filter and are
    using a `GtkTreeModel`FilterVisibleFunc. Using any of the non-atomic operations
    to append rows to the `GtkListStore` will cause the
    `GtkTreeModel`FilterVisibleFunc to be visited with an empty row first; the
    function must be prepared for that.

    ## GtkListStore as GtkBuildable

    The GtkListStore implementation of the [iface@Gtk.Buildable] interface allows
    to specify the model columns with a `<columns>` element that may contain
    multiple `<column>` elements, each specifying one model column. The “type”
    attribute specifies the data type for the column.

    Additionally, it is possible to specify content for the list store
    in the UI definition, with the `<data>` element. It can contain multiple
    `<row>` elements, each specifying to content for one row of the list model.
    Inside a `<row>`, the `<col>` elements specify the content for individual cells.

    Note that it is probably more common to define your models in the code,
    and one might consider it a layering violation to specify the content of
    a list store in a UI definition, data, not presentation, and common wisdom
    is to separate the two, as far as possible.

    An example of a UI Definition fragment for a list store:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkListStore">
      <columns>
        <column type="gchararray"/>
        <column type="gchararray"/>
        <column type="gint"/>
      </columns>
      <data>
        <row>
          <col id="0">John</col>
          <col id="1">Doe</col>
          <col id="2">25</col>
        </row>
        <row>
          <col id="0">Johan</col>
          <col id="1">Dahlin</col>
          <col id="2">50</col>
        </row>
      </data>
    </object>

        `GtkTreeModel`::rows-reordered for every inserted value.

        Since emitting the `GtkTreeModel::rows-reordered` signal repeatedly can

    Presents a large dynamic list of items.

    `GtkListView` uses its factory to generate one row widget for each visible
    item and shows them in a linear display, either vertically or horizontally.

    The [property@Gtk.ListView:show-separators] property offers a simple way to
    display separators between the rows.

    `GtkListView` allows the user to select items according to the selection
    characteristics of the model. For models that allow multiple selected items,
    it is possible to turn on _rubberband selection_, using
    [property@Gtk.ListView:enable-rubberband].

    If you need multiple columns with headers, see [class@Gtk.ColumnView].

    To learn more about the list widget framework, see the
    [overview](section-list-widget.html).

    An example of using `GtkListView`:
    ```c
    static void
    setup_listitem_cb (GtkListItemFactory *factory,
                       GtkListItem        *list_item)

    # Actions

    `GtkListView` defines a set of built-in actions:

    - `list.activate-item` activates the item at given position by emitting
      the [signal@Gtk.ListView::activate] signal.

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    listview[.separators][.rich-list][.navigation-sidebar][.data-table]
    ├── row[.activatable]
    │
    ├── row[.activatable]
    │
    ┊
    ╰── [rubberband]
    ```

    `GtkListView` uses a single CSS node named `listview`. It may carry the
    `.separators` style class, when [property@Gtk.ListView:show-separators]
    property is set. Each child widget uses a single CSS node named `row`.
    If the [property@Gtk.ListItem:activatable] property is set, the
    corresponding row will have the `.activatable` style class. For
    rubberband selection, a node with name `rubberband` is used.

    The main listview node may also carry style classes to select
    the style of [list presentation](ListContainers.html#list-styles):
    .rich-list, .navigation-sidebar or .data-table.

    `GtkLockButton` is a widget to obtain and revoke authorizations
    needed to operate the controls.

    <picture>
      <source srcset="lockbutton-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An example GtkLockButton" src="lockbutton.png">
    </picture>

    It is typically used in preference dialogs or control panels.

    The required authorization is represented by a `GPermission` object.
    Concrete implementations of `GPermission` may use PolicyKit or some
    other authorization framework. To obtain a PolicyKit-based
    `GPermission`, use `polkit_permission_new()`.

    If the user is not currently allowed to perform the action, but can
    obtain the permission, the widget looks like this:

    <picture>
      <source srcset="lockbutton-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An locked GtkLockButton" src="lockbutton.png">
    </picture>

    and the user can click the button to request the permission. Depending
    on the platform, this may pop up an authentication dialog or ask the user
    to authenticate in some other way. Once the user has obtained the permission,
    the widget changes to this:

    <picture>
      <source srcset="lockbutton-unlocked-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An unlocked GtkLockButton" src="lockbutton-unlocked.png">
    </picture>

    and the permission can be dropped again by clicking the button. If the user
    is not able to obtain the permission at all, the widget looks like this:

    <picture>
      <source srcset="lockbutton-sorry-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An unobtainable GtkLockButton" src="lockbutton-sorry.png">
    </picture>

    If the user has the permission and cannot drop it, the button is hidden.

    The text (and tooltips) that are shown in the various cases can be adjusted
    with the [property@Gtk.LockButton:text-lock],
    [property@Gtk.LockButton:text-unlock],
    [property@Gtk.LockButton:tooltip-lock],
    [property@Gtk.LockButton:tooltip-unlock] and
    [property@Gtk.LockButton:tooltip-not-authorized] properties.

    The `GtkMenuButton` widget can show either an icon (set with the
    [property@Gtk.MenuButton:icon-name] property) or a label (set with the
    [property@Gtk.MenuButton:label] property). If neither is explicitly set,
    a [class@Gtk.Image] is automatically created, using an arrow image oriented
    according to [property@Gtk.MenuButton:direction] or the generic
    “open-menu-symbolic” icon if the direction is not set.

    The positioning of the popup is determined by the
    [property@Gtk.MenuButton:direction] property of the menu button.

    For menus, the [property@Gtk.Widget:halign] and [property@Gtk.Widget:valign]
    properties of the menu are also taken into account. For example, when the
    direction is %GTK_ARROW_DOWN and the horizontal alignment is %GTK_ALIGN_START,
    the menu will be positioned below the button, with the starting edge
    (depending on the text direction) of the menu aligned with the starting
    edge of the button. If there is not enough space below the button, the
    menu is popped up above the button instead. If the alignment would move
    part of the menu offscreen, it is “pushed in”.

    `.arrow-button` style class.

    the indicator, which will carry one of the `.none`, `.up`, `.down`,
    `.left` or `.right` style classes to indicate the direction that
    the menu will appear in. The CSS is expected to provide a suitable
    image for each of these cases using the `-gtk-icon-source` property.

    Optionally, the `menubutton` node can carry the `.circular` style class
    to request a round appearance.

class MessageDialog(Dialog):
    """
    `GtkMessageDialog` presents a dialog with some message text.

    <picture>
      <source srcset="messagedialog-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An example GtkMessageDialog" src="messagedialog.png">
    </picture>

    It’s simply a convenience widget; you could construct the equivalent of
    `GtkMessageDialog` from `GtkDialog` without too much effort, but
    `GtkMessageDialog` saves typing.

    The easiest way to do a modal message dialog is to use the %GTK_DIALOG_MODAL
    flag, which will call [method@Gtk.Window.set_modal] internally. The dialog will
    prevent interaction with the parent window until it's hidden or destroyed.
    You can use the [signal@Gtk.Dialog::response] signal to know when the user
    dismissed the dialog.

    An example for using a modal dialog:
    ```c
    GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT | GTK_DIALOG_MODAL;
    dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                     flags,
                                     GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                     GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                     "Error reading “%s”: %s",
                                     filename,
                                     g_strerror (errno));
    // Destroy the dialog when the user responds to it
    // (e.g. clicks a button)

    g_signal_connect (dialog, "response",
                      G_CALLBACK (gtk_window_destroy),
                      NULL);
    ```

    You might do a non-modal `GtkMessageDialog` simply by omitting the
    %GTK_DIALOG_MODAL flag:

    ```c
    GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
    dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                     flags,
                                     GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                     GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                     "Error reading “%s”: %s",
                                     filename,
                                     g_strerror (errno));

    // Destroy the dialog when the user responds to it
    // (e.g. clicks a button)
    g_signal_connect (dialog, "response",
                      G_CALLBACK (gtk_window_destroy),
                      NULL);
    ```

    </picture>

    There are many configuration options for `GtkNotebook`. Among
    other things, you can choose on which edge the tabs appear
    (see [method@Gtk.Notebook.set_tab_pos]), whether, if there are
    too many tabs to fit the notebook should be made bigger or scrolling
    arrows added (see [method@Gtk.Notebook.set_scrollable]), and whether
    there will be a popup menu allowing the users to switch pages.
    (see [method@Gtk.Notebook.popup_enable]).

    # GtkNotebook as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkNotebook` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface
    supports placing children into tabs by specifying “tab” as the
    “type” attribute of a `<child>` element. Note that the content
    of the tab must be created before the tab can be filled.
    A tab child can be specified without specifying a `<child>`
    type attribute.

    To add a child widget in the notebooks action area, specify
    "action-start" or “action-end” as the “type” attribute of the
    `<child>` element.

    An example of a UI definition fragment with `GtkNotebook`:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkNotebook">
      <child>
        <object class="GtkLabel" id="notebook-content">
          <property name="label">Content</property>
        </object>
      </child>
      <child type="tab">
        <object class="GtkLabel" id="notebook-tab">
          <property name="label">Tab</property>
        </object>
      </child>
    </object>
    ```

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkNotebook` supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> or <kbd>Menu</kbd> opens the context menu.
    - <kbd>Home</kbd> moves the focus to the first tab.
    - <kbd>End</kbd> moves the focus to the last tab.

    Additionally, the following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.Notebook::change-current-page]
    - [signal@Gtk.Notebook::focus-tab]
    - [signal@Gtk.Notebook::move-focus-out]
    - [signal@Gtk.Notebook::reorder-tab]
    - [signal@Gtk.Notebook::select-page]

    Tabs support drag-and-drop between notebooks sharing the same `group-name`,
    or to new windows by handling the `::create-window` signal.

    # Actions

    `GtkNotebook` defines a set of built-in actions:

    - `menu.popup` opens the tabs context menu.

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    notebook
    ├── header.top
    │   ├── [<action widget>]
    │   ├── tabs
    │   │   ├── [arrow]
    │   │   ├── tab
    │   │   │   ╰── <tab label>
    ┊   ┊   ┊
    │   │   ├── tab[.reorderable-page]
    │   │   │   ╰── <tab label>
    │   │   ╰── [arrow]
    │   ╰── [<action widget>]
    │
    ╰── stack
        ├── <child>
        ┊
        ╰── <child>
    ```

    `GtkNotebook` has a main CSS node with name `notebook`, a subnode
    with name `header` and below that a subnode with name `tabs` which
    contains one subnode per tab with name `tab`.

    If action widgets are present, their CSS nodes are placed next
    to the `tabs` node. If the notebook is scrollable, CSS nodes with
    name `arrow` are placed as first and last child of the `tabs` node.

    The main node gets the `.frame` style class when the notebook
    has a border (see [method@Gtk.Notebook.set_show_border]).

    The header node gets one of the style class `.top`, `.bottom`,
    `.left` or `.right`, depending on where the tabs are placed. For
    reorderable pages, the tab node gets the `.reorderable-page` class.

    A `tab` node gets the `.dnd` style class while it is moved with drag-and-drop.

    The nodes are always arranged from left-to-right, regardless of text direction.

    # Accessibility

    `GtkNotebook` uses the following roles:

     - [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.group] for the notebook widget
     - [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.tab_list] for the list of tabs
     - [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.tab] role for each tab
     - [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.tab_panel] for each page

        If you want a widget to interact with a notebook through DnD
        (i.e.: accept dragged tabs from it) it must be set as a drop
        destination by adding to it a [class@Gtk.DropTarget] controller that accepts
        the GType `GTK_TYPE_NOTEBOOK_PAGE`. The `:value` of said drop target will be
        preloaded with a [class@Gtk.NotebookPage] object that corresponds to the
        dropped tab, so you can process the value via `::accept` or `::drop` signals.

        Note that you should use [method@Gtk.Notebook.detach_tab] instead
        of [method@Gtk.Notebook.remove_page] if you want to remove the tab
        from the source notebook as part of accepting a drop. Otherwise,
        the source notebook will think that the dragged tab was removed
        from underneath the ongoing drag operation, and will initiate a
        drag cancel animation.

    Handles input from the pads found in drawing tablets.

    Pads are the collection of buttons and tactile sensors often found around
    the stylus-sensitive area.

    These buttons and sensors have no implicit meaning, and by default they
    perform no action. `GtkPadController` is provided to map those to
    [iface@Gio.Action] objects, thus letting the application give them a more
    semantic meaning.

    Buttons and sensors are not constrained to triggering a single action,
    some %GDK_SOURCE_TABLET_PAD devices feature multiple "modes". All these
    input elements have one current mode, which may determine the final action
    being triggered.

    Pad devices often divide buttons and sensors into groups. All elements
    in a group share the same current mode, but different groups may have
    different modes. See [method@Gdk.DevicePad.get_n_groups] and
    [method@Gdk.DevicePad.get_group_n_modes].

    Each of the actions that a given button/strip/ring performs for a given mode
    is defined by a [struct@Gtk.PadActionEntry]. It contains an action name that
    will be looked up in the given [iface@Gio.ActionGroup] and activated whenever
    the specified input element and mode are triggered.

    A simple example of `GtkPadController` usage: Assigning button 1 in all
    modes and pad devices to an "invert-selection" action:

    ```c
    GtkPadActionEntry *pad_actions[] = {
      { GTK_PAD_ACTION_BUTTON, 1, -1, "Invert selection", "pad-actions.invert-selection" },
      …
    };

    action = g_simple_action_new ("pad-actions.invert-selection", NULL);
    g_signal_connect (action, "activate", on_invert_selection_activated, NULL);
    g_action_map_add_action (G_ACTION_MAP (action_group), action);
    …
    pad_controller = gtk_pad_controller_new (action_group, NULL);
    ```

    The actions belonging to rings/strips will be activated with a parameter
    of type %G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE bearing the value of the given axis, it
    is required that those are made stateful and accepting this `GVariantType`.

    The division between the two panes is adjustable by the user
    by dragging a handle.

    Child widgets are added to the panes of the widget with
    [method@Gtk.Paned.set_start_child] and [method@Gtk.Paned.set_end_child].
    The division between the two children is set by default from the size
    requests of the children, but it can be adjusted by the user.

    A paned widget draws a separator between the two child widgets and a
    small handle that the user can drag to adjust the division. It does not
    draw any relief around the children or around the separator. (The space
    in which the separator is called the gutter.) Often, it is useful to put
    each child inside a [class@Gtk.Frame] so that the gutter appears as a
    ridge. No separator is drawn if one of the children is missing.

    Each child has two options that can be set, "resize" and "shrink". If
    "resize" is true then, when the `GtkPaned` is resized, that child will
    expand or shrink along with the paned widget. If "shrink" is true, then
    that child can be made smaller than its requisition by the user.
    Setting "shrink" to false allows the application to set a minimum size.
    If "resize" is false for both children, then this is treated as if
    "resize" is true for both children.

    The application can set the position of the slider as if it were set
    by the user, by calling [method@Gtk.Paned.set_position].

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    The following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.Paned::accept-position]
    - [signal@Gtk.Paned::cancel-position]
    - [signal@Gtk.Paned::cycle-child-focus]
    - [signal@Gtk.Paned::cycle-handle-focus]
    - [signal@Gtk.Paned::move-handle]
    - [signal@Gtk.Paned::toggle-handle-focus]

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    paned
    ├── <child>
    ├── separator[.wide]
    ╰── <child>
    ```

    `GtkPaned` has a main CSS node with name paned, and a subnode for
    the separator with name separator. The subnode gets a .wide style
    class when the paned is supposed to be wide.

    In horizontal orientation, the nodes are arranged based on the text
    direction, so in left-to-right mode, :first-child will select the
    leftmost child, while it will select the rightmost child in
    RTL layouts.

    </picture>

    Many convenience functions are provided to make pictures simple to use.
    For example, if you want to load an image from a file, and then display
    it, there’s a convenience function to do this:

    ```c
    GtkWidget *widget = gtk_picture_new_for_filename ("myfile.png");
    ```

    If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the picture will contain a
    “broken image” icon similar to that used in many web browsers.
    If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
    for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
    [ctor@Gdk.Texture.new_from_file], then create the `GtkPicture` with
    [ctor@Gtk.Picture.new_for_paintable].

    Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data
    files, such as image files. See the documentation of `GResource` for details.
    In this case, [ctor@Gtk.Picture.new_for_resource] and
    [method@Gtk.Picture.set_resource] should be used.

    `GtkPicture` displays an image at its natural size. See [class@Gtk.Image]
    if you want to display a fixed-size image, such as an icon.

    ## Sizing the paintable

    You can influence how the paintable is displayed inside the `GtkPicture`
    by changing [property@Gtk.Picture:content-fit]. See [enum@Gtk.ContentFit]
    for details. [property@Gtk.Picture:can-shrink] can be unset to make sure
    that paintables are never made smaller than their ideal size - but
    be careful if you do not know the size of the paintable in use (like
    when displaying user-loaded images). This can easily cause the picture to
    grow larger than the screen. And [property@Gtk.Widget:halign] and
    [property@Gtk.Widget:valign] can be used to make sure the paintable doesn't
    fill all available space but is instead displayed at its original size.

    ## CSS nodes

    `GtkPicture` has a single CSS node with the name `picture`.

    It is primarily meant to provide context-dependent information
    or options. Popovers are attached to a parent widget. By default,
    they point to the whole widget area, although this behavior can be
    changed with [method@Gtk.Popover.set_pointing_to].

    The position of a popover relative to the widget it is attached to
    can also be changed with [method@Gtk.Popover.set_position]

    By default, `GtkPopover` performs a grab, in order to ensure input
    events get redirected to it while it is shown, and also so the popover
    is dismissed in the expected situations (clicks outside the popover,
    or the Escape key being pressed). If no such modal behavior is desired
    on a popover, [method@Gtk.Popover.set_autohide] may be called on it to
    tweak its behavior.

    ## GtkPopover as menu replacement

    `GtkPopover` is often used to replace menus. The best way to do this
    is to use the [class@Gtk.PopoverMenu] subclass which supports being
    populated from a `GMenuModel` with [ctor@Gtk.PopoverMenu.new_from_model].

    ```xml
    <section>
      <attribute name="display-hint">horizontal-buttons</attribute>
      <item>
        <attribute name="label">Cut</attribute>
        <attribute name="action">app.cut</attribute>

    ```

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkPopover` supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - <kbd>Escape</kbd> closes the popover.
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd> makes the mnemonics visible.

    The following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.Popover::activate-default]

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    popover.background[.menu]
    ├── arrow
    ╰── contents
        ╰── <child>
    ```

    `GtkPopover` has a main node with name `popover`, an arrow with name `arrow`,
    and another node for the content named `contents`. The `popover` node always
    gets the `.background` style class. It also gets the `.menu` style class
    if the popover is menu-like, e.g. is a [class@Gtk.PopoverMenu].

    Particular uses of `GtkPopover`, such as touch selection popups or
    magnifiers in `GtkEntry` or `GtkTextView` get style classes like
    `.touch-selection` or `.magnifier` to differentiate from plain popovers.

    When styling a popover directly, the `popover` node should usually
    not have any background. The visible part of the popover can have
    a shadow. To specify it in CSS, set the box-shadow of the `contents` node.

    Note that, in order to accomplish appropriate arrow visuals, `GtkPopover`
    uses custom drawing for the `arrow` node. This makes it possible for the
    arrow to change its shape dynamically, but it also limits the possibilities
    of styling it using CSS. In particular, the `arrow` gets drawn over the
    `content` node's border and shadow, so they look like one shape, which
    means that the border width of the `content` node and the `arrow` node should
    be the same. The arrow also does not support any border shape other than
    solid, no border-radius, only one border width (border-bottom-width is
    used) and no box-shadow.

class PopoverMenu(Popover):
    """
    A subclass of `GtkPopover` that implements menu behavior.

    <picture>

      <img alt="An example GtkPopoverMenu" src="menu.png">

    `GtkPopoverMenu` treats its children like menus and allows switching
    between them. It can open submenus as traditional, nested submenus,
    or in a more touch-friendly sliding fashion.
    The property [property@Gtk.PopoverMenu:flags] controls this appearance.

    `GtkPopoverMenu` is meant to be used primarily with menu models,
    using [ctor@Gtk.PopoverMenu.new_from_model]. If you need to put
    other widgets such as a `GtkSpinButton` or a `GtkSwitch` into a popover,
    you can use [method@Gtk.PopoverMenu.add_child].

    For more dialog-like behavior, use a plain `GtkPopover`.

    ## Menu models

    The XML format understood by `GtkBuilder` for `GMenuModel` consists
    of a toplevel `<menu>` element, which contains one or more `<item>`
    elements. Each `<item>` element contains `<attribute>` and `<link>`
    elements with a mandatory name attribute. `<link>` elements have the
    same content model as `<menu>`. Instead of `<link name="submenu">`
    or `<link name="section">`, you can use `<submenu>` or `<section>`
    elements.

    ```xml
    <menu id='app-menu'>
      <section>
        <item>
          <attribute name='label' translatable='yes'>_New Window</attribute>
          <attribute name='action'>app.new</attribute>
        </item>
        <item>
          <attribute name='label' translatable='yes'>_About Sunny</attribute>
          <attribute name='action'>app.about</attribute>
        </item>
        <item>
          <attribute name='label' translatable='yes'>_Quit</attribute>
          <attribute name='action'>app.quit</attribute>
        </item>
      </section>
    </menu>
    ```

    Attribute values can be translated using gettext, like other `GtkBuilder`
    content. `<attribute>` elements can be marked for translation with a
    `translatable="yes"` attribute. It is also possible to specify message
    context and translator comments, using the context and comments attributes.
    To make use of this, the `GtkBuilder` must have been given the gettext
    domain to use.

    The following attributes are used when constructing menu items:

    - "label": a user-visible string to display
    - "use-markup": whether the text in the menu item includes [Pango markup](https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/pango_markup.html)
    - "action": the prefixed name of the action to trigger
    - "target": the parameter to use when activating the action
    - "icon" and "verb-icon": names of icons that may be displayed
    - "submenu-action": name of an action that may be used to track
         whether a submenu is open
    - "hidden-when": a string used to determine when the item will be hidden.
         Possible values include "action-disabled", "action-missing", "macos-menubar".
         This is mainly useful for exported menus, see [method@Gtk.Application.set_menubar].
    - "custom": a string used to match against the ID of a custom child added with
         [method@Gtk.PopoverMenu.add_child], [method@Gtk.PopoverMenuBar.add_child],
         or in the ui file with `<child type="ID">`.

    The following attributes are used when constructing sections:

    - "label": a user-visible string to use as section heading
    - "display-hint": a string used to determine special formatting for the section.
        Possible values include "horizontal-buttons", "circular-buttons" and
        "inline-buttons". They all indicate that section should be
        displayed as a horizontal row of buttons.
    - "text-direction": a string used to determine the `GtkTextDirection` to use
        when "display-hint" is set to "horizontal-buttons". Possible values
        include "rtl", "ltr", and "none".

    The following attributes are used when constructing submenus:

    - "label": a user-visible string to display
    - "icon": icon name to display

    Menu items will also show accelerators, which are usually associated
    with actions via [method@Gtk.Application.set_accels_for_action],
    [method@WidgetClass.add_binding_action] or
    [method@Gtk.ShortcutController.add_shortcut].

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkPopoverMenu` supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - <kbd>Space</kbd> activates the default widget.

    # CSS Nodes

    `GtkPopoverMenu` is just a subclass of `GtkPopover` that adds custom content
    to it, therefore it has the same CSS nodes. It is one of the cases that add
    a `.menu` style class to the main `popover` node.

    Menu items have nodes with name `button` and class `.model`. If a section
    display-hint is set, the section gets a node `box` with class `horizontal`
    plus a class with the same text as the display hint. Note that said box may
    not be the direct ancestor of the item `button`s. Thus, for example, to style
    items in an `inline-buttons` section, select `.inline-buttons button.model`.
    Other things that may be of interest to style in menus include `label` nodes.

    # Accessibility

    `GtkPopoverMenu` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.menu] role, and its
    items use the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.menu_item],
    [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.checkbox] or [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.menu_item_radio]
    roles, depending on the action they are connected to.

class PrintOperation(GObject.Object):
    """
    High-level, portable printing API.

    It looks a bit different than other GTK dialogs such as the
    `GtkFileChooser`, since some platforms don’t expose enough
    infrastructure to implement a good print dialog. On such
    platforms, `GtkPrintOperation` uses the native print dialog.
    On platforms which do not provide a native print dialog, GTK
    uses its own, see [class@Gtk.PrintUnixDialog].

    The typical way to use the high-level printing API is to create
    a `GtkPrintOperation` object with [ctor@Gtk.PrintOperation.new]
    when the user selects to print. Then you set some properties on it,
    e.g. the page size, any [class@Gtk.PrintSettings] from previous print
    operations, the number of pages, the current page, etc.

    Then you start the print operation by calling [method@Gtk.PrintOperation.run].
    It will then show a dialog, let the user select a printer and options.
    When the user finished the dialog, various signals will be emitted on
    the `GtkPrintOperation`, the main one being
    [signal@Gtk.PrintOperation::draw-page], which you are supposed to handle
    and render the page on the provided [class@Gtk.PrintContext] using Cairo.

    # The high-level printing API

    ```c
    static GtkPrintSettings *settings = NULL;

    static void
    do_print (void)
    {
      GtkPrintOperation *print;
      GtkPrintOperationResult res;

      print = gtk_print_operation_new ();

      if (settings != NULL)
        gtk_print_operation_set_print_settings (print, settings);

      g_signal_connect (print, "begin_print", G_CALLBACK (begin_print), NULL);
      g_signal_connect (print, "draw_page", G_CALLBACK (draw_page), NULL);

      res = gtk_print_operation_run (print, GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_ACTION_PRINT_DIALOG,
                                     GTK_WINDOW (main_window), NULL);

          settings = g_object_ref (gtk_print_operation_get_print_settings (print));
        }

      g_object_unref (print);
    }
    ```

    By default `GtkPrintOperation` uses an external application to do
    print preview. To implement a custom print preview, an application
    must connect to the preview signal. The functions
    [method@Gtk.PrintOperationPreview.render_page],
    [method@Gtk.PrintOperationPreview.end_preview] and
    [method@Gtk.PrintOperationPreview.is_selected]
    are useful when implementing a print preview.

class ProgressBar(Widget):

    Displays the progress of a long-running operation.

    `GtkProgressBar` provides a visual clue that processing is underway.
    It can be used in two different modes: percentage mode and activity mode.

      <source srcset="progressbar-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An example GtkProgressBar" src="progressbar.png">
    </picture>

    When an application can determine how much work needs to take place
    (e.g. read a fixed number of bytes from a file) and can monitor its
    progress, it can use the `GtkProgressBar` in percentage mode and the
    user sees a growing bar indicating the percentage of the work that
    has been completed. In this mode, the application is required to call
    [method@Gtk.ProgressBar.set_fraction] periodically to update the progress bar.

    When an application has no accurate way of knowing the amount of work
    to do, it can use the `GtkProgressBar` in activity mode, which shows
    activity by a block moving back and forth within the progress area. In
    this mode, the application is required to call [method@Gtk.ProgressBar.pulse]
    periodically to update the progress bar.

    There is quite a bit of flexibility provided to control the appearance
    of the `GtkProgressBar`. Functions are provided to control the orientation
    of the bar, optional text can be displayed along with the bar, and the
    step size used in activity mode can be set.

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    progressbar[.osd]
    ├── [text]
    ╰── trough[.empty][.full]
        ╰── progress[.pulse]
    ```

    `GtkProgressBar` has a main CSS node with name progressbar and subnodes with
    names text and trough, of which the latter has a subnode named progress. The
    text subnode is only present if text is shown. The progress subnode has the
    style class .pulse when in activity mode. It gets the style classes .left,
    .right, .top or .bottom added when the progress 'touches' the corresponding
    end of the GtkProgressBar. The .osd class on the progressbar node is for use
    in overlays like the one Epiphany has for page loading progress.

    Manages and looks up recently used files.

    that have registered it, the number of time each application has
    registered the same file, the mime type of the file and whether
    the file should be displayed only by the applications that have
    registered it.

    The recently used files list is per user.

    `GtkRecentManager` acts like a database of all the recently
    used files. You can create new `GtkRecentManager` objects, but
    it is more efficient to use the default manager created by GTK.

    Adding a new recently used file is as simple as:

    ```c
    GtkRecentManager *manager;

    manager = gtk_recent_manager_get_default ();
    gtk_recent_manager_add_item (manager, file_uri);
    ```

    The `GtkRecentManager` will try to gather all the needed information
    from the file itself through GIO.

    Looking up the meta-data associated with a recently used file
    given its URI requires calling [method@Gtk.RecentManager.lookup_item]:

    ```c
    GtkRecentManager *manager;
    GtkRecentInfo *info;
    GError *error = NULL;

    manager = gtk_recent_manager_get_default ();
    info = gtk_recent_manager_lookup_item (manager, file_uri, &error);
    if (error)
      {
        g_warning ("Could not find the file: %s", error->message);
        g_error_free (error);
      }
    else
     {
       // Use the info object
       gtk_recent_info_unref (info);
     }
    ```

    In order to retrieve the list of recently used files, you can use
    [method@Gtk.RecentManager.get_items], which returns a list of
    [struct@Gtk.RecentInfo].

    Note that the maximum age of the recently used files list is
    controllable through the [property@Gtk.Settings:gtk-recent-files-max-age]

    To use it, you’ll probably want to investigate the methods on its base
    class, [class@Gtk.Range], in addition to the methods for `GtkScale` itself.
    To set the value of a scale, you would normally use [method@Gtk.Range.set_value].
    To detect changes to the value, you would normally use the
    [signal@Gtk.Range::value-changed] signal.

    Note that using the same upper and lower bounds for the `GtkScale` (through
    the `GtkRange` methods) will hide the slider itself. This is useful for
    applications that want to show an undeterminate value on the scale, without
    changing the layout of the application (such as movie or music players).

    # GtkScale as GtkBuildable

    `GtkScale` supports a custom `<marks>` element, which can contain multiple
    `<mark>` elements. The “value” and “position” attributes have the same
    meaning as [method@Gtk.Scale.add_mark] parameters of the same name. If
    the element is not empty, its content is taken as the markup to show at
    the mark. It can be translated with the usual ”translatable” and
    “context” attributes.

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkPopoverMenu` supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - Arrow keys, <kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> will increment or decrement
      by step, or by page when combined with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.
    - <kbd>PgUp</kbd> and <kbd>PgDn</kbd> will increment or decrement by page.
    - <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> will set the minimum or maximum value.

        ╰── slider
    ```

    `GtkScale` has a main CSS node with name scale and a subnode for its contents,
    with subnodes named trough and slider.

    The main node gets the style class .fine-tune added when the scale is in
    'fine-tuning' mode.

    If the scale has an origin (see [method@Gtk.Scale.set_has_origin]), there is
    a subnode with name highlight below the trough node that is used for rendering
    the highlighted part of the trough.

    If the scale is showing a fill level (see [method@Gtk.Range.set_show_fill_level]),
    there is a subnode with name fill below the trough node that is used for
    rendering the filled in part of the trough.

    If marks are present, there is a marks subnode before or after the trough
    node, below which each mark gets a node with name mark. The marks nodes get
    either the .top or .bottom style class.

    The mark node has a subnode named indicator. If the mark has text, it also
    has a subnode named label. When the mark is either above or left of the
    scale, the label subnode is the first when present. Otherwise, the indicator
    subnode is the first.

    The main CSS node gets the 'marks-before' and/or 'marks-after' style classes
    added depending on what marks are present.

    If the scale is displaying the value (see [property@Gtk.Scale:draw-value]),
    there is subnode with name value. This node will get the .top or .bottom style
    classes similar to the marks node.

    To implement this interface you should override the

    ## Creating a scrollable widget

    All scrollable widgets should do the following.

    - When a parent widget sets the scrollable child widget’s adjustments,
      the widget should connect to the [signal@Gtk.Adjustment::value-changed]
      signal. The child widget should then populate the adjustments’ properties

      implementation.

    - Because its preferred size is the size for a fully expanded widget,
      the scrollable widget must be able to cope with underallocations.
      This means that it must accept any value passed to its
      [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.size_allocate] implementation.

    - When the parent allocates space to the scrollable child widget,
      the widget must ensure the adjustments’ property values are correct and up
      to date, for example using [method@Gtk.Adjustment.configure].

    - When any of the adjustments emits the [signal@Gtk.Adjustment::value-changed]
      signal, the scrollable widget should scroll its contents.

    Its position and movement are controlled by the adjustment that is passed to

    scrollable area.

    The fields [property@Gtk.Adjustment:step-increment] and
    [property@Gtk.Adjustment:page-increment] fields are added to or subtracted
    from the [property@Gtk.Adjustment:value] when the user asks to move by a step

    `GtkScrollbar` has a main CSS node with name scrollbar and a subnode for its
    contents. The main node gets the .horizontal or .vertical style classes applied,
    depending on the scrollbar's orientation.

    The range node gets the style class .fine-tune added when the scrollbar is
    in 'fine-tuning' mode.

    Other style classes that may be added to scrollbars inside
    [class@Gtk.ScrolledWindow] include the positional classes (.left, .right,
    .top, .bottom) and style classes related to overlay scrolling (.overlay-indicator,
    .dragging, .hovering).

    It does so using either internally added scrollbars or externally
    associated adjustments, and optionally draws a frame around the child.

    Widgets with native scrolling support, i.e. those whose classes implement
    the [iface@Gtk.Scrollable] interface, are added directly. For other types
    of widget, the class [class@Gtk.Viewport] acts as an adaptor, giving
    scrollability to other widgets. [method@Gtk.ScrolledWindow.set_child]
    intelligently accounts for whether or not the added child is a `GtkScrollable`.
    If it isn’t, then it wraps the child in a `GtkViewport`. Therefore, you can
    just add any child widget and not worry about the details.

    If [method@Gtk.ScrolledWindow.set_child] has added a `GtkViewport` for you,
    it will be automatically removed when you unset the child.
    Unless [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:hscrollbar-policy] and
    [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:vscrollbar-policy] are %GTK_POLICY_NEVER or
    %GTK_POLICY_EXTERNAL, `GtkScrolledWindow` adds internal `GtkScrollbar` widgets
    around its child. The scroll position of the child, and if applicable the
    scrollbars, is controlled by the [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:hadjustment]
    and [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:vadjustment] that are associated with the
    `GtkScrolledWindow`. See the docs on [class@Gtk.Scrollbar] for the details,
    but note that the “step_increment” and “page_increment” fields are only
    effective if the policy causes scrollbars to be present.

    If a `GtkScrolledWindow` doesn’t behave quite as you would like, or
    doesn’t have exactly the right layout, it’s very possible to set up
    your own scrolling with `GtkScrollbar` and for example a `GtkGrid`.

    # Touch support

    `GtkScrolledWindow` has built-in support for touch devices. When a
    touchscreen is used, swiping will move the scrolled window, and will
    expose 'kinetic' behavior. This can be turned off with the
    [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:kinetic-scrolling] property if it is undesired.

    `GtkScrolledWindow` also displays visual 'overshoot' indication when
    the content is pulled beyond the end, and this situation can be
    captured with the [signal@Gtk.ScrolledWindow::edge-overshot] signal.

    If no mouse device is present, the scrollbars will overlaid as
    narrow, auto-hiding indicators over the content. If traditional
    scrollbars are desired although no mouse is present, this behaviour
    can be turned off with the [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:overlay-scrolling]
    property.

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    The following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.ScrolledWindow::scroll-child]

    # CSS nodes

    `GtkScrolledWindow` has a main CSS node with name scrolledwindow.
    It gets a .frame style class added when [property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:has-frame]
    is %TRUE.

    It uses subnodes with names overshoot and undershoot to draw the overflow
    and underflow indications. These nodes get the .left, .right, .top or .bottom
    style class added depending on where the indication is drawn.

    `GtkScrolledWindow` also sets the positional style classes (.left, .right,
    .top, .bottom) and style classes related to overlay scrolling
    (.overlay-indicator, .dragging, .hovering) on its scrollbars.

    If both scrollbars are visible, the area where they meet is drawn
    with a subnode named junction.

    # Accessibility

    Until GTK 4.10, `GtkScrolledWindow` used the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.group] role.

    Starting from GTK 4.12, `GtkScrolledWindow` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.generic]
    role.

    It can also contain additional widgets, such as drop-down menus,
    or buttons.  The search bar would appear when a search is started
    through typing on the keyboard, or the application’s search mode
    is toggled on.

    For keyboard presses to start a search, the search bar must be told
    of a widget to capture key events from through
    [method@Gtk.SearchBar.set_key_capture_widget]. This widget will
    typically be the top-level window, or a parent container of the
    search bar. Common shortcuts such as Ctrl+F should be handled as an
    application action, or through the menu items.

    You will also need to tell the search bar about which entry you
    are using as your search entry using [method@Gtk.SearchBar.connect_entry].

    ## Creating a search bar

    The following example shows you how to create a more complex search
    entry.

    [A simple example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/main/examples/search-bar.c)

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkSearchBar` supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - <kbd>Escape</kbd> hides the search bar.

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    searchbar
    ╰── revealer
        ╰── box
             ├── [child]
             ╰── [button.close]
    ```

    `GtkSearchBar` has a main CSS node with name searchbar. It has a child
    node with name revealer that contains a node with name box. The box node
    contains both the CSS node of the child widget as well as an optional button
    node which gets the .close style class applied.

class SearchEntry(Widget):
    """
    A single-line text entry widget for use as a search entry.

    The main API for interacting with a `GtkSearchEntry` as entry
    is the `GtkEditable` interface.

    <picture>
      <source srcset="search-entry-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An example GtkSearchEntry" src="search-entry.png">
    </picture>

    It will show an inactive symbolic “find” icon when the search
    entry is empty, and a symbolic “clear” icon when there is text.
    Clicking on the “clear” icon will empty the search entry.

    To make filtering appear more reactive, it is a good idea to
    not react to every change in the entry text immediately, but
    only after a short delay. To support this, `GtkSearchEntry`
    emits the [signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::search-changed] signal which
    can be used instead of the [signal@Gtk.Editable::changed] signal.

    The [signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::previous-match],
    [signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::next-match] and
    [signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::stop-search] signals can be used to
    implement moving between search results and ending the search.

    Often, `GtkSearchEntry` will be fed events by means of being
    placed inside a [class@Gtk.SearchBar]. If that is not the case,
    you can use [method@Gtk.SearchEntry.set_key_capture_widget] to
    let it capture key input from another widget.

    `GtkSearchEntry` provides only minimal API and should be used with
    the [iface@Gtk.Editable] API.

    ## Shortcuts and Gestures

    The following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::activate]
    - [signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::next-match]
    - [signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::previous-match]
    - [signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::stop-search]

    ## CSS Nodes

    ```
    entry.search
    ╰── text
    ```

    `GtkSearchEntry` has a single CSS node with name entry that carries
    a `.search` style class, and the text node is a child of that.

    ## Accessibility

    `GtkSearchEntry` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.search_box] role.

    """
    An interface that adds support for selection to list models.

    This support is then used by widgets using list models to add the ability
    to select and unselect various items.

    GTK provides default implementations of the most common selection modes such
    as [class@Gtk.SingleSelection], so you will only need to implement this
    interface if you want detailed control about how selections should be handled.

    A `GtkSelectionModel` supports a single boolean per item indicating if an item is
    selected or not. This can be queried via [method@Gtk.SelectionModel.is_selected].
    When the selected state of one or more items changes, the model will emit the
    [signal@Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed] signal by calling the
    [method@Gtk.SelectionModel.selection_changed] function. The positions given
    in that signal may have their selection state changed, though that is not a
    requirement. If new items added to the model via the
    [signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed] signal are selected or not is up to the
    implementation.

    Note that items added via [signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed] may already
    be selected and no [signal@Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed] will be
    emitted for them. So to track which items are selected, it is necessary to
    listen to both signals.

    Additionally, the interface can expose functionality to select and unselect
    items. If these functions are implemented, GTK's list widgets will allow users
    to select and unselect items. However, `GtkSelectionModel`s are free to only
    implement them partially or not at all. In that case the widgets will not
    support the unimplemented operations.

    When selecting or unselecting is supported by a model, the return values of
    the selection functions do *not* indicate if selection or unselection happened.
    They are only meant to indicate complete failure, like when this mode of
    selecting is not supported by the model.

    Selections may happen asynchronously, so the only reliable way to find out
    when an item was selected is to listen to the signals that indicate selection.

    utilities that let the user change these settings.

    On Wayland, the settings are obtained either via a settings portal,
    or by reading desktop settings from [class@Gio.Settings].

    On macOS, the settings are obtained from `NSUserDefaults`.

    In the absence of these sharing mechanisms, GTK reads default values for
    settings from `settings.ini` files in `/etc/gtk-4.0`, `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gtk-4.0`
    and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-4.0`. These files must be valid key files (see
    `GKeyFile`), and have a section called Settings. Themes can also provide
    default values for settings by installing a `settings.ini` file
    next to their `gtk.css` file.

    Applications can override system-wide settings by setting the property
    of the `GtkSettings` object with g_object_set(). This should be restricted
    to special cases though; `GtkSettings` are not meant as an application
    configuration facility.

    There is one `GtkSettings` instance per display. It can be obtained with

    to global actions using [method@Gtk.Application.set_accels_for_action].

    But it is possible to create your own shortcut controller, and add

    `GtkShortcutController` implements [iface@Gio.ListModel] for querying the
    shortcuts that have been added to it.

    # GtkShortcutController as GtkBuildable

    `GtkShortcutController`s can be created in [class@Gtk.Builder] ui files, to set up
    shortcuts in the same place as the widgets.

    An example of a UI definition fragment with `GtkShortcutController`:
    ```xml
      <object class='GtkButton'>
        <child>
          <object class='GtkShortcutController'>
            <property name='scope'>managed</property>

              <object class='GtkShortcut'>

      </object>
    ```

    This example creates a [class@Gtk.ActivateAction] for triggering the
    `activate` signal of the [class@Gtk.Button]. See [ctor@Gtk.ShortcutAction.parse_string]

    A `GtkShortcutsWindow` shows information about the keyboard shortcuts
    and gestures of an application.

    The shortcuts can be grouped, and you can have multiple sections in this
    window, corresponding to the major modes of your application.

    Additionally, the shortcuts can be filtered by the current view, to avoid
    showing information that is not relevant in the current application context.

    The recommended way to construct a `GtkShortcutsWindow` is with
    [class@Gtk.Builder], by using the `<child>` tag to populate a
    `GtkShortcutsWindow` with one or more [class@Gtk.ShortcutsSection] objects,
    which contain one or more [class@Gtk.ShortcutsGroup] instances, which, in turn,
    contain [class@Gtk.ShortcutsShortcut] instances.

    If you need to add a section programmatically, use [method@Gtk.ShortcutsWindow.add_section]
    instead of [method@Gtk.Window.set_child], as the shortcuts window manages
    its children directly.

    # A simple example:

    <picture>
      <source srcset="gedit-shortcuts-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="A simple example" src="gedit-shortcuts.png">
    </picture>

    This example has as single section. As you can see, the shortcut groups
    are arranged in columns, and spread across several pages if there are too
    many to find on a single page.

    The .ui file for this example can be found [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/main/demos/gtk-demo/shortcuts-gedit.ui).

    # An example with multiple views:

      <img alt="An example with multiple views" src="clocks-shortcuts.png">
    </picture>

    This example shows a `GtkShortcutsWindow` that has been configured to show only
    the shortcuts relevant to the “Stopwatch” view.

    The .ui file for this example can be found [here](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/main/demos/gtk-demo/shortcuts-clocks.ui).

      <source srcset="builder-shortcuts-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="An example with multiple sections" src="builder-shortcuts.png">

    This example shows a `GtkShortcutsWindow` with two sections, “Editor Shortcuts”
    and “Terminal Shortcuts”.

    Signals are emitted for every listitem in the same order:

     1. [signal@Gtk.SignalListItemFactory::setup] is emitted to set up permanent
     things on the listitem. This usually means constructing the widgets used in
     the row and adding them to the listitem.

     2. [signal@Gtk.SignalListItemFactory::bind] is emitted to bind the item passed
     via [property@Gtk.ListItem:item] to the widgets that have been created in
     step 1 or to add item-specific widgets. Signals are connected to listen to
     changes - both to changes in the item to update the widgets or to changes
     in the widgets to update the item. After this signal has been called, the
     listitem may be shown in a list widget.

     3. [signal@Gtk.SignalListItemFactory::unbind] is emitted to undo everything
     done in step 2. Usually this means disconnecting signal handlers. Once this
     signal has been called, the listitem will no longer be used in a list
     widget.

     4. [signal@Gtk.SignalListItemFactory::bind] and
     [signal@Gtk.SignalListItemFactory::unbind] may be emitted multiple times
     again to bind the listitem for use with new items. By reusing listitems,
     potentially costly setup can be avoided. However, it means code needs to
     make sure to properly clean up the listitem in step 3 so that no information
     from the previous use leaks into the next one.

     5. [signal@Gtk.SignalListItemFactory::teardown] is emitted to allow undoing
     the effects of [signal@Gtk.SignalListItemFactory::setup]. After this signal
     was emitted on a listitem, the listitem will be destroyed and not be used again.

    Note that during the signal emissions, changing properties on the listitems
    passed will not trigger notify signals as the listitem's notifications are
    frozen. See [method@GObject.Object.freeze_notify()] for details.

    For tracking changes in other properties in the listitem, the
    ::notify signal is recommended. The signal can be connected in the
    [signal@Gtk.SignalListItemFactory::setup] signal and removed again during
    [signal@Gtk.SignalListItemFactory::teardown].

class SizeGroup(GObject.Object):

    Groups widgets together so they all request the same size.

    This is typically useful when you want a column of widgets to have
    the same size, but you can’t use a [class@Gtk.Grid] or [class@Gtk.Box].

    In detail, the size requested for each widget in a `GtkSizeGroup` is
    the maximum of the sizes that would have been requested for each
    widget in the size group if they were not in the size group. The
    [mode][method@Gtk.SizeGroup.set_mode] of the size group determines
    whether this applies to the horizontal size, the vertical size, or
    both sizes.

    Note that size groups only affect the amount of space requested, not
    the size that the widgets finally receive. If you want the widgets in
    a `GtkSizeGroup` to actually be the same size, you need to pack them in
    such a way that they get the size they request and not more. In
    particular it doesn't make a lot of sense to set
    [the expand flags][method@Gtk.Widget.set_hexpand] on the widgets that
    are members of a size group.

    `GtkSizeGroup` objects are referenced by each widget in the size group,
    so once you have added all widgets to a `GtkSizeGroup`, you can drop
    the initial reference to the size group with
    [method@GObject.Object.unref]. If the widgets in the size group are
    subsequently destroyed, then they will be removed from the size group
    and drop their references on the size group; when all widgets have been
    removed, the size group will be freed.

    Widgets can be part of multiple size groups; GTK will compute the
    horizontal size of a widget from the horizontal requisition of all widgets
    that can be reached from the widget by a chain of size groups with mode
    [enum@Gtk.SizeGroupMode.HORIZONTAL] or [enum@Gtk.SizeGroupMode.BOTH], and
    the vertical size from the vertical requisition of all widgets that can be
    reached from the widget by a chain of size groups with mode
    [enum@Gtk.SizeGroupMode.VERTICAL] or [enum@Gtk.SizeGroupMode.BOTH].

    # Size groups and trading height-for-width

    ::: warning
        Generally, size groups don't interact well with widgets that
        trade height for width (or width for height), such as wrappable
        labels. Avoid using size groups with such widgets.

    A size group with mode [enum@Gtk.SizeGroupMode.HORIZONTAL] or
    [enum@Gtk.SizeGroupMode.VERTICAL] only consults non-contextual sizes
    of widgets other than the one being measured, since it has no
    knowledge of what size a widget will get allocated in the other
    orientation. This can lead to widgets in a group actually requesting
    different contextual sizes, contrary to the purpose of
    `GtkSizeGroup`.

    In contrast, a size group with mode [enum@Gtk.SizeGroupMode.BOTH] can
    properly propagate the available size in the opposite orientation
    when measuring widgets in the group, which results in consistent and
    accurate measurements.

    In case some mechanism other than a size group is already used to
    ensure that widgets in a group all get the same size in one
    orientation (for example, some common ancestor is known to allocate
    the same width to all its children), and the size group is only
    really needed to also make the widgets request the same size in the
    other orientation, it is beneficial to still set the group's mode to
    [enum@Gtk.SizeGroupMode.BOTH]. This lets the group assume and count
    on sizes of the widgets in the former orientation being the same,
    which enables it to propagate the available size as described above.

    # Alternatives to size groups

    Size groups have many limitations, such as only influencing size
    requests but not allocations, and poor height-for-width support. When
    possible, prefer using dedicated mechanisms that can properly ensure
    that the widgets get the same size.

    Various container widgets and layout managers support a homogeneous
    layout mode, where they will explicitly give the same size to their
    children (see [property@Gtk.Box:homogeneous]). Using homogeneous mode
    can also have large performance benefits compared to either the same
    container in non-homogeneous mode, or to size groups.

    [class@Gtk.Grid] can be used to position widgets into rows and
    columns. Members of each column will have the same width among them;
    likewise, members of each row will have the same height. On top of
    that, the heights can be made equal between all rows with
    [property@Gtk.Grid:row-homogeneous], and the widths can be made equal
    between all columns with [property@Gtk.Grid:column-homogeneous].

    # GtkSizeGroup as GtkBuildable

    Size groups can be specified in a UI definition by placing an `<object>`
    element with `class="GtkSizeGroup"` somewhere in the UI definition. The
    widgets that belong to the size group are specified by a `<widgets>` element
    that may contain multiple `<widget>` elements, one for each member of the
    size group. The ”name” attribute gives the id of the widget.

    An example of a UI definition fragment with `GtkSizeGroup`:
    ```xml
    <object class="GtkSizeGroup">
      <property name="mode">horizontal</property>
      <widgets>
        <widget name="radio1"/>
        <widget name="radio2"/>
      </widgets>
    </object>

    Rather than having to directly type a number into a `GtkEntry`,
    `GtkSpinButton` allows the user to click on one of two arrows
    to increment or decrement the displayed value. A value can still be
    typed in, with the bonus that it can be checked to ensure it is in a
    given range.

    The main properties of a `GtkSpinButton` are through an adjustment.
    See the [class@Gtk.Adjustment] documentation for more details about
    an adjustment's properties.

    Note that `GtkSpinButton` will by default make its entry large enough
    to accommodate the lower and upper bounds of the adjustment. If this
    is not desired, the automatic sizing can be turned off by explicitly
    setting [property@Gtk.Editable:width-chars] to a value != -1.

    ## Using a GtkSpinButton to get an integer

    ```c
    // Provides a function to retrieve an integer value from a GtkSpinButton
    // and creates a spin button to model percentage values.

    int
    grab_int_value (GtkSpinButton *button,
                    gpointer       user_data)
    {
      return gtk_spin_button_get_value_as_int (button);
    }

    void
    create_integer_spin_button (void)
    {

      GtkWidget *window, *button;
      GtkAdjustment *adjustment;

      adjustment = gtk_adjustment_new (50.0, 0.0, 100.0, 1.0, 5.0, 0.0);

      window = gtk_window_new ();

      // creates the spinbutton, with no decimal places
      button = gtk_spin_button_new (adjustment, 1.0, 0);
      gtk_window_set_child (GTK_WINDOW (window), button);

      gtk_window_present (GTK_WINDOW (window));
    }
    ```

    ## Using a GtkSpinButton to get a floating point value

    ```c
    // Provides a function to retrieve a floating point value from a
    // GtkSpinButton, and creates a high precision spin button.

    float
    grab_float_value (GtkSpinButton *button,
                      gpointer       user_data)
    {
      return gtk_spin_button_get_value (button);
    }

    void
    create_floating_spin_button (void)
    {
      GtkWidget *window, *button;
      GtkAdjustment *adjustment;

      adjustment = gtk_adjustment_new (2.500, 0.0, 5.0, 0.001, 0.1, 0.0);

      window = gtk_window_new ();

      // creates the spinbutton, with three decimal places
      button = gtk_spin_button_new (adjustment, 0.001, 3);
      gtk_window_set_child (GTK_WINDOW (window), button);

      gtk_window_present (GTK_WINDOW (window));
    }
    ```

    `GtkSpinButton`s main CSS node has the name spinbutton. It creates subnodes
    for the entry and the two buttons, with these names. The button nodes have
    the style classes .up and .down. The `GtkText` subnodes (if present) are put
    below the text node. The orientation of the spin button is reflected in
    the .vertical or .horizontal style class on the main node.

    obtain the `GtkStackPage` for a child with [method@Gtk.Stack.get_page]
    and you can obtain a `GtkSelectionModel` containing all the pages
    with [method@Gtk.Stack.get_pages].

    # GtkStack as GtkBuildable

    To set child-specific properties in a .ui file, create `GtkStackPage`
    objects explicitly, and set the child widget as a property on it:

    ```xml
      <object class="GtkStack" id="stack">
        <child>
          <object class="GtkStackPage">
            <property name="name">page1</property>
            <property name="title">In the beginning…</property>
            <property name="child">
              <object class="GtkLabel">
                <property name="label">It was dark</property>
              </object>
            </property>
          </object>
        </child>
    ```

    # CSS nodes

    `GtkStack` has a single CSS node named stack.

    # Accessibility

    `GtkStack` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.tab_panel] role for the stack
    pages, which are the accessible parent objects of the child widgets.

    [class@Gtk.StackPage] objects; the button visibility in a `GtkStackSwitcher`
    widget is controlled by the visibility of the child in the `GtkStack`.

    It is possible to associate multiple `GtkStackSwitcher` widgets
    with the same `GtkStack` widget.

    # CSS nodes

    `GtkStackSwitcher` has a single CSS node named stackswitcher and
    style class .stack-switcher.

    When circumstances require it, `GtkStackSwitcher` adds the
    .needs-attention style class to the widgets representing the
    stack pages.

    # Accessibility

    `GtkStackSwitcher` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.tab_list] role
    and uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.tab] role for its buttons.

    # Orientable

    Since GTK 4.4, `GtkStackSwitcher` implements `GtkOrientable` allowing
    the stack switcher to be made vertical with
    `gtk_orientable_set_orientation()`.

    A `GtkStatusbar` widget is usually placed along the bottom of an application's
    main [class@Gtk.Window].

      <img alt="An example GtkStatusbar" src="statusbar.png">
    </picture>

    A `GtkStatusBar` may provide a regular commentary of the application's
    status (as is usually the case in a web browser, for example), or may be
    used to simply output a message when the status changes, (when an upload
    is complete in an FTP client, for example).

    Status bars in GTK maintain a stack of messages. The message at
    the top of the each bar’s stack is the one that will currently be displayed.

    Any messages added to a statusbar’s stack must specify a context id that
    is used to uniquely identify the source of a message. This context id can
    be generated by [method@Gtk.Statusbar.get_context_id], given a message and
    the statusbar that it will be added to. Note that messages are stored in a
    stack, and when choosing which message to display, the stack structure is
    adhered to, regardless of the context identifier of a message.

    One could say that a statusbar maintains one stack of messages for
    display purposes, but allows multiple message producers to maintain
    sub-stacks of the messages they produced (via context ids).

    Status bars are created using [ctor@Gtk.Statusbar.new].

    Messages are added to the bar’s stack with [method@Gtk.Statusbar.push].

    The message at the top of the stack can be removed using
    [method@Gtk.Statusbar.pop]. A message can be removed from anywhere in the
    stack if its message id was recorded at the time it was added. This is done
    using [method@Gtk.Statusbar.remove].

    `GtkStyleContext` stores styling information affecting a widget.

    In order to construct the final style information, `GtkStyleContext`
    queries information from all attached `GtkStyleProviders`. Style
    providers can be either attached explicitly to the context through
    [method@Gtk.StyleContext.add_provider], or to the display through
    [func@Gtk.StyleContext.add_provider_for_display]. The resulting
    style is a combination of all providers’ information in priority order.

    For GTK widgets, any `GtkStyleContext` returned by
    [method@Gtk.Widget.get_style_context] will already have a `GdkDisplay`
    and RTL/LTR information set. The style context will also be updated
    automatically if any of these settings change on the widget.

    ## Style Classes

    Widgets can add style classes to their context, which can be used to associate
    different styles by class. The documentation for individual widgets lists
    which style classes it uses itself, and which style classes may be added by
    applications to affect their appearance.

    # Custom styling in UI libraries and applications

    If you are developing a library with custom widgets that render differently
    than standard components, you may need to add a `GtkStyleProvider` yourself
    with the %GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK priority, either a
    `GtkCssProvider` or a custom object implementing the `GtkStyleProvider`
    interface. This way themes may still attempt to style your UI elements in
    a different way if needed so.

    If you are using custom styling on an applications, you probably want then
    to make your style information prevail to the theme’s, so you must use
    a `GtkStyleProvider` with the %GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION
    priority, keep in mind that the user settings in
    `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-4.0/gtk.css` will
    still take precedence over your changes, as it uses the
    %GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER priority.

    [class@Gtk.SpinButton], and other widgets. In all of these, a `GtkText`
    instance is used as the delegate for the [iface@Gtk.Editable] implementation.

    A large number of key bindings s supported by default. If the entered
    text is longer than the allocation of the widget, the widget will scroll
    so that the cursor position is visible.

    When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information,
    it can be put into “password mode” using [method@Gtk.Text.set_visibility].
    In this mode, entered text is displayed using an “invisible” character.
    By default, GTK picks the best invisible character that is available
    in the current font, but it can be changed with
    [method@Gtk.Text.set_invisible_char].

    If you want to add icons or progress display in an entry, look at
    [class@Gtk.Entry]. There are other alternatives for more specialized
    use cases, such as [class@Gtk.SearchEntry].

    If you need multi-line editable text, use [class@Gtk.TextView].

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkText` supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> or <kbd>Menu</kbd> opens the context menu.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&sol;</kbd>
      selects all the text.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> or
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&bsol;</kbd> unselects all.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> undoes the last modification.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>
      redoes the last undone modification.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> toggles the text direction.

    Additionally, the following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.Text::activate]

    - [signal@Gtk.Text::paste-clipboard]
    - [signal@Gtk.Text::toggle-overwrite]

    # Actions

    `GtkText` defines a set of built-in actions:

    - `clipboard.copy` copies the contents to the clipboard.
    - `clipboard.cut` copies the contents to the clipboard and deletes it from
      the widget.
    - `clipboard.paste` inserts the contents of the clipboard into the widget.
    - `menu.popup` opens the context menu.
    - `misc.insert-emoji` opens the Emoji chooser.
    - `misc.toggle-visibility` toggles the `GtkText`:visibility property.
    - `misc.toggle-direction` toggles the text direction.
    - `selection.delete` deletes the current selection.
    - `selection.select-all` selects all of the widgets content.
    - `text.redo` redoes the last change to the contents.
    - `text.undo` undoes the last change to the contents.

    `GtkText` has a main node with the name `text`. Depending on the properties
    of the widget, the `.read-only` style class may appear.

    When the entry has a selection, it adds a subnode with the name `selection`.

    When the entry is in overwrite mode, it adds a subnode with the name
    `block-cursor` that determines how the block cursor is drawn.

    The CSS node for a context menu is added as a subnode with the name `popup`.

    The `undershoot` nodes are used to draw the underflow indication when content
    is scrolled out of view. These nodes get the `.left` or `.right` style class
    added depending on where the indication is drawn.

    When touch is used and touch selection handles are shown, they are using
    CSS nodes with name `cursor-handle`. They get the `.top` or `.bottom` style
    class depending on where they are shown in relation to the selection. If
    there is just a single handle for the text cursor, it gets the style class
    `.insertion-cursor`.

    # Accessibility

    `GtkText` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.none] role, which causes it to be
    skipped for accessibility. This is because `GtkText` is expected to be used
    as a delegate for a `GtkEditable` implementation that will be represented
    to accessibility.

    Marks a position in a `GtkTextbuffer` that is preserved

    You may wish to begin by reading the
    [text widget conceptual overview](section-text-widget.html),
    which gives an overview of all the objects and data types
    related to the text widget and how they work together.

    A `GtkTextMark` is like a bookmark in a text buffer; it preserves
    a position in the text. You can convert the mark to an iterator using
    [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.get_iter_at_mark]. Unlike iterators, marks remain
    valid across buffer mutations, because their behavior is defined when
    text is inserted or deleted. When text containing a mark is deleted,
    the mark remains in the position originally occupied by the deleted
    text. When text is inserted at a mark, a mark with “left gravity” will
    be moved to the beginning of the newly-inserted text, and a mark with
    “right gravity” will be moved to the end.

    Note that “left” and “right” here refer to logical direction (left
    is the toward the start of the buffer); in some languages such as
    Hebrew the logically-leftmost text is not actually on the left when
    displayed.

    Marks are reference counted, but the reference count only controls
    the validity of the memory; marks can be deleted from the buffer at
    any time with [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.delete_mark]. Once deleted from
    the buffer, a mark is essentially useless.

    Marks optionally have names; these can be convenient to avoid passing
    the `GtkTextMark` object around.

    Marks are typically created using the [method@Gtk.TextBuffer.create_mark]
    function.

    - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> or <kbd>Menu</kbd> opens the context menu.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> undoes the last modification.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>
      redoes the last undone modification.

    Additionally, the following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.TextView::backspace]
    - [signal@Gtk.TextView::copy-clipboard]
    - [signal@Gtk.TextView::cut-clipboard]
    - [signal@Gtk.TextView::delete-from-cursor]
    - [signal@Gtk.TextView::insert-emoji]
    - [signal@Gtk.TextView::move-cursor]
    - [signal@Gtk.TextView::paste-clipboard]
    - [signal@Gtk.TextView::select-all]
    - [signal@Gtk.TextView::toggle-cursor-visible]
    - [signal@Gtk.TextView::toggle-overwrite]

    ## Actions

    `GtkTextView` defines a set of built-in actions:

    - `clipboard.copy` copies the contents to the clipboard.
    - `clipboard.cut` copies the contents to the clipboard and deletes it from
      the widget.
    - `clipboard.paste` inserts the contents of the clipboard into the widget.
    - `menu.popup` opens the context menu.
    - `misc.insert-emoji` opens the Emoji chooser.
    - `selection.delete` deletes the current selection.
    - `selection.select-all` selects all of the widgets content.
    - `text.redo` redoes the last change to the contents.
    - `text.undo` undoes the last change to the contents.

    ## CSS nodes

    ```
    textview.view
    ├── border.top
    ├── border.left
    ├── text
    │   ╰── [selection]
    ├── border.right
    ├── border.bottom
    ╰── [window.popup]
    ```

    `GtkTextView` has a main css node with name textview and style class .view,
    and subnodes for each of the border windows, and the main text area,
    with names border and text, respectively. The border nodes each get
    one of the style classes .left, .right, .top or .bottom.

    A node representing the selection will appear below the text node.

    If a context menu is opened, the window node will appear as a subnode
    of the main node.

    ## Accessibility

    `GtkTextView` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.text_box] role.

    </picture>

    Clicking again will cause the toggle button to return to its normal state.

    A toggle button is created by calling either [ctor@Gtk.ToggleButton.new] or
    [ctor@Gtk.ToggleButton.new_with_label]. If using the former, it is advisable
    to pack a widget, (such as a `GtkLabel` and/or a `GtkImage`), into the toggle
    button’s container. (See [class@Gtk.Button] for more information).

    The state of a `GtkToggleButton` can be set specifically using
    [method@Gtk.ToggleButton.set_active], and retrieved using
    [method@Gtk.ToggleButton.get_active].

    ## Grouping

    Toggle buttons can be grouped together, to form mutually exclusive
    groups - only one of the buttons can be toggled at a time, and toggling
    another one will switch the currently toggled one off.

    To add a `GtkToggleButton` to a group, use [method@Gtk.ToggleButton.set_group].

    ## CSS nodes

    `GtkToggleButton` has a single CSS node with name button. To differentiate
    it from a plain `GtkButton`, it gets the `.toggle` style class.

    ## Accessibility

    `GtkToggleButton` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.toggle_button] role.

    Represents a widget tooltip.

    Basic tooltips can be realized simply by using
    [method@Gtk.Widget.set_tooltip_text] or
    [method@Gtk.Widget.set_tooltip_markup] without
    any explicit tooltip object.

    When you need a tooltip with a little more fancy contents,
    like adding an image, or you want the tooltip to have different
    contents per `GtkTreeView` row or cell, you will have to do a
    little more work:

    - Set the [property@Gtk.Widget:has-tooltip] property to %TRUE.
      This will make GTK monitor the widget for motion and related events
      which are needed to determine when and where to show a tooltip.

    - Connect to the [signal@Gtk.Widget::query-tooltip] signal.
      This signal will be emitted when a tooltip is supposed to be shown.
      One of the arguments passed to the signal handler is a `GtkTooltip`

class TreeExpander(Widget):
    """
    Provides an expander for a tree-like list.

    It is typically placed as a bottommost child into a `GtkListView`
    to allow users to expand and collapse children in a list with a
    [class@Gtk.TreeListModel]. `GtkTreeExpander` provides the common UI
    elements, gestures and keybindings for this purpose.

    On top of this, the "listitem.expand", "listitem.collapse" and
    "listitem.toggle-expand" actions are provided to allow adding custom
    UI for managing expanded state.

    It is important to mention that you want to set the
    [property@Gtk.ListItem:focusable] property to FALSE when using this
    widget, as you want the keyboard focus to be in the treexpander, and not
    inside the list to make use of the keybindings.

    The `GtkTreeListModel` must be set to not be passthrough. Then it
    will provide [class@Gtk.TreeListRow] items which can be set via
    [method@Gtk.TreeExpander.set_list_row] on the expander.
    The expander will then watch that row item automatically.
    [method@Gtk.TreeExpander.set_child] sets the widget that displays
    the actual row contents.

    `GtkTreeExpander` can be modified with properties such as
    [property@Gtk.TreeExpander:indent-for-icon],
    [property@Gtk.TreeExpander:indent-for-depth], and
    [property@Gtk.TreeExpander:hide-expander] to achieve a different appearance.
    This can even be done to influence individual rows, for example by binding
    the [property@Gtk.TreeExpander:hide-expander] property to the item count of
    the model of the treelistrow, to hide the expander for rows without children,
    even if the row is expandable.

    ## Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkTreeExpander` supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - <kbd>+</kbd> or <kbd>*</kbd> expands the expander.
    - <kbd>-</kbd> or <kbd>/</kbd> collapses the expander.
    - Left and right arrow keys, when combined with <kbd>Shift</kbd> or
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>, will expand or collapse, depending on
      the locale's text direction.
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>␣</kbd> toggles the expander state.

    The row can also expand on drag gestures.

    ## Actions

    `GtkTreeExpander` defines a set of built-in actions:

    - `listitem.expand` expands the expander if it can be expanded.
    - `listitem.collapse` collapses the expander.
    - `listitem.toggle-expand` tries to expand the expander if it was collapsed
      or collapses it if it was expanded.

    ## CSS nodes

    ```
    treeexpander
    ├── [indent]*
    ├── [expander]
    ╰── <child>
    ```

    `GtkTreeExpander` has zero or one CSS nodes with the name "expander" that
    should display the expander icon. The node will be `:checked` when it
    is expanded. If the node is not expandable, an "indent" node will be
    displayed instead.

    For every level of depth, another "indent" node is prepended.

    ## Accessibility

    Until GTK 4.10, `GtkTreeExpander` used the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.group] role.

    Since GTK 4.12, `GtkTreeExpander` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.button] role.
    Toggling it will change the `GTK_ACCESSIBLE_STATE_EXPANDED` state.

class TreeModel(GObject.GInterface):
    """
    The tree interface used by GtkTreeView

    The `GtkTreeModel` interface defines a generic tree interface for
    use by the `GtkTreeView` widget. It is an abstract interface, and
    is designed to be usable with any appropriate data structure. The
    programmer just has to implement this interface on their own data
    type for it to be viewable by a `GtkTreeView` widget.

    The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
    columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where
    every node has different values depending on which column is being
    queried. The type of data found in a column is determined by using
    the GType system (ie. %G_TYPE_INT, %GTK_TYPE_BUTTON, %G_TYPE_POINTER,
    etc). The types are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is
    important to note that this interface only provides a way of examining
    a model and observing changes. The implementation of each individual
    model decides how and if changes are made.

    In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to
    write their own specialized model, two generic models are provided
    — the `GtkTreeStore` and the `GtkListStore`. To use these, the
    developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
    models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
    interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
    storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
    these two models are sufficient.

    Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
    query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
    column on that node. There are two structures used to reference a
    particular node in a model. They are the [struct@Gtk.TreePath] and
    the [struct@Gtk.TreeIter] (“iter” is short for iterator). Most of the
    interface consists of operations on a [struct@Gtk.TreeIter].

    A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
    that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
    model. A [struct@Gtk.TreePath] can be converted into either an
    array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
    of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
    at that level. Thus, the path `0` refers to the root
    node and the path `2:4` refers to the fifth child of
    the third node.

    By contrast, a [struct@Gtk.TreeIter] is a reference to a specific node on
    a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
    generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
    way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
    gtk_tree_model_get_iter(). These iterators are the primary way
    of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
    `GtkTextBuffer`. They are generally statically allocated on the
    stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
    a set of operations using them for navigating the model.

    It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
    For example, the `GtkListStore` model, which is internally a simple
    linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
    `GtkTreeModel`Sort stores an array and an offset in two of the
    pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
    generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
    catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.

    The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
    Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
    is unchanged (and doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered
    to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
    free them from the user’s point of view. Additionally, some models
    guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
    to is valid (most notably the `GtkTreeStore` and `GtkListStore`).
    Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
    the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
    important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
    As a result, the %GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST flag was added to
    indicate this behavior.

    To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
    provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
    the location `3:2:5`. While the first method shown is
    easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
    callbacks.

    ## Acquiring a `GtkTreeIter`

    ```c
    // Three ways of getting the iter pointing to the location
    GtkTreePath *path;
    GtkTreeIter iter;
    GtkTreeIter parent_iter;

    // get the iterator from a string
    gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model,
                                         &iter,
                                         "3:2:5");

    // get the iterator from a path
    path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("3:2:5");
    gtk_tree_model_get_iter (model, &iter, path);
    gtk_tree_path_free (path);

    // walk the tree to find the iterator
    gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                                   NULL, 3);
    parent_iter = iter;
    gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                                   &parent_iter, 2);
    parent_iter = iter;
    gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                                   &parent_iter, 5);
    ```

    This second example shows a quick way of iterating through a list
    and getting a string and an integer from each row. The
    populate_model() function used below is not
    shown, as it is specific to the `GtkListStore`. For information on
    how to write such a function, see the `GtkListStore` documentation.

    ## Reading data from a `GtkTreeModel`

    ```c
    enum
    {
      STRING_COLUMN,
      INT_COLUMN,
      N_COLUMNS
    };

    ...

    GtkTreeModel *list_store;
    GtkTreeIter iter;
    gboolean valid;
    int row_count = 0;

    // make a new list_store
    list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                     G_TYPE_STRING,
                                     G_TYPE_INT);

    // Fill the list store with data
    populate_model (list_store);

    // Get the first iter in the list, check it is valid and walk
    // through the list, reading each row.

    valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (list_store,
                                           &iter);
    while (valid)
     {
       char *str_data;
       int    int_data;

       // Make sure you terminate calls to gtk_tree_model_get() with a “-1” value
       gtk_tree_model_get (list_store, &iter,
                           STRING_COLUMN, &str_data,
                           INT_COLUMN, &int_data,
                           -1);

       // Do something with the data
       g_print ("Row %d: (%s,%d)\\n",
                row_count, str_data, int_data);
       g_free (str_data);

       valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (list_store,
                                         &iter);
       row_count++;
     }
    ```

    The `GtkTreeModel` interface contains two methods for reference
    counting: gtk_tree_model_ref_node() and gtk_tree_model_unref_node().
    These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
    is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
    displayed. `GtkTreeView` will take a reference on a node when it is
    visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
    Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
    visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
    scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
    a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
    not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
    folders that are currently expanded in every current view.

    When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
    into account:

    - Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
      This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
      as well.

    - Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
      possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
      row-deleted signal is received.

    - Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
      siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
      required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
      however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level
      is always referenced when any view is attached).

class TreeModelFilter(GObject.Object):
    """
    A `GtkTreeModel` which hides parts of an underlying tree model

    A `GtkTreeModelFilter` is a tree model which wraps another tree model,
    and can do the following things:

    - Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
      storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not,
      or based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a
      model, iter and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the
      row should be filtered or not.

    - Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function.
      This is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some
      values and also for creating a completely different model based
      on the given child model.

    - Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass
      in a `GtkTreePath` indicating the root node for the filter at construction
      time.

    The basic API is similar to `GtkTreeModelSort`. For an example on its usage,
    see the section on `GtkTreeModelSort`.

    When using `GtkTreeModelFilter`, it is important to realize that
    `GtkTreeModelFilter` maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are
    visible in its clients. The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree
    exposed by the child model. `GtkTreeModelFilter` will not cache the entire
    child model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism
    that is exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model
    implements reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted
    because of reference counting rule 3, see the `GtkTreeModel`
    documentation. (Note that e.g. `GtkTreeStore` does not implement
    reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
    the receiving node is not visible).

    Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply.
    In general, visible functions should only use data or properties from
    the node for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings
    or its parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child
    node is not possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly.
    When no such reference exists, no signals may be received for these child
    nodes (see reference counting rule number 3 in the `GtkTreeModel` section).

    Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state
    of its child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
    `GtkTreeModelFilter` explicitly supports this. For example, when a node
    does not have any children, you might not want the node to be visible.
    As soon as the first row is added to the node’s child level (or the
    last row removed), the node’s visibility should be updated.

    This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order
    to accommodate this, `GtkTreeModelFilter` must make sure the necessary
    signals are received from the child model. This is achieved by building,
    for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to `GtkTreeModelFilter`'s
    clients, the child level (if any) and take a reference on the first node
    in this level. Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or
    row-deleted signal (also these which were not handled because the node
    was not cached), `GtkTreeModelFilter` will check if the visibility state
    of any parent node has changed.

    Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two
    cases. For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes
    in a child’s child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your
    own. In this case, either rely on `GtkTreeStore` to emit all signals
    because it does not implement reference counting, or for models that
    do implement reference counting, obtain references on these child levels
    yourself.

class TreeModelSort(GObject.Object):
    """
    A GtkTreeModel which makes an underlying tree model sortable

    The `GtkTreeModelSort` is a model which implements the `GtkTreeSortable`
    interface.  It does not hold any data itself, but rather is created with
    a child model and proxies its data.  It has identical column types to
    this child model, and the changes in the child are propagated.  The
    primary purpose of this model is to provide a way to sort a different
    model without modifying it. Note that the sort function used by
    `GtkTreeModelSort` is not guaranteed to be stable.

    The use of this is best demonstrated through an example.  In the
    following sample code we create two `GtkTreeView` widgets each with a
    view of the same data.  As the model is wrapped here by a
    `GtkTreeModelSort`, the two `GtkTreeView`s can each sort their
    view of the data without affecting the other.  By contrast, if we
    simply put the same model in each widget, then sorting the first would
    sort the second.

    ## Using a `GtkTreeModelSort`

    ```c
    {
      GtkTreeView *tree_view1;
      GtkTreeView *tree_view2;
      GtkTreeModel *sort_model1;
      GtkTreeModel *sort_model2;
      GtkTreeModel *child_model;

      // get the child model
      child_model = get_my_model ();

      // Create the first tree
      sort_model1 = gtk_tree_model_sort_new_with_model (child_model);
      tree_view1 = gtk_tree_view_new_with_model (sort_model1);

      // Create the second tree
      sort_model2 = gtk_tree_model_sort_new_with_model (child_model);
      tree_view2 = gtk_tree_view_new_with_model (sort_model2);

      // Now we can sort the two models independently
      gtk_tree_sortable_set_sort_column_id (GTK_TREE_SORTABLE (sort_model1),
                                            COLUMN_1, GTK_SORT_ASCENDING);
      gtk_tree_sortable_set_sort_column_id (GTK_TREE_SORTABLE (sort_model2),
                                            COLUMN_1, GTK_SORT_DESCENDING);
    }
    ```

    To demonstrate how to access the underlying child model from the sort
    model, the next example will be a callback for the `GtkTreeSelection`
    `GtkTreeSelection::changed` signal.  In this callback, we get a string
    from COLUMN_1 of the model.  We then modify the string, find the same
    selected row on the child model, and change the row there.

    ## Accessing the child model of in a selection changed callback

    ```c
    void
    selection_changed (GtkTreeSelection *selection, gpointer data)
    {
      GtkTreeModel *sort_model = NULL;
      GtkTreeModel *child_model;
      GtkTreeIter sort_iter;
      GtkTreeIter child_iter;
      char *some_data = NULL;
      char *modified_data;

      // Get the current selected row and the model.
      if (! gtk_tree_selection_get_selected (selection,
                                             &sort_model,
                                             &sort_iter))
        return;

      // Look up the current value on the selected row and get
      // a new value to change it to.
      gtk_tree_model_get (GTK_TREE_MODEL (sort_model), &sort_iter,
                          COLUMN_1, &some_data,
                          -1);

      modified_data = change_the_data (some_data);
      g_free (some_data);

      // Get an iterator on the child model, instead of the sort model.
      gtk_tree_model_sort_convert_iter_to_child_iter (GTK_TREE_MODEL_SORT (sort_model),
                                                      &child_iter,
                                                      &sort_iter);

      // Get the child model and change the value of the row. In this
      // example, the child model is a GtkListStore. It could be any other
      // type of model, though.

    The selection object for GtkTreeView

    The `GtkTreeSelection` object is a helper object to manage the selection
    for a `GtkTreeView` widget.  The `GtkTreeSelection` object is
    automatically created when a new `GtkTreeView` widget is created, and
    cannot exist independently of this widget.  The primary reason the
    `GtkTreeSelection` objects exists is for cleanliness of code and API.
    That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions could not be
    methods on the `GtkTreeView` widget instead of a separate function.

    The `GtkTreeSelection` object is gotten from a `GtkTreeView` by calling
    gtk_tree_view_get_selection().  It can be manipulated to check the
    selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect individual
    rows.  Selection is done completely view side.  As a result, multiple
    views of the same model can have completely different selections.
    Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that
    is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents
    first.

    One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of
    a view is that the `GtkTreeSelection`::changed signal is mostly a hint.
    That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is selected.
    Additionally, it may on occasion emit a `GtkTreeSelection`::changed signal
    when nothing has happened (mostly as a result of programmers calling
    select_row on an already selected row).

    Widget that displays any object that implements the [iface@Gtk.TreeModel] interface.

    Please refer to the [tree widget conceptual overview](section-tree-widget.html)
    for an overview of all the objects and data types related to the tree
    widget and how they work together.

    ## Coordinate systems in GtkTreeView API

    Several different coordinate systems are exposed in the `GtkTreeView` API.
    These are:

    ![](tree-view-coordinates.png)

    - Widget coordinates: Coordinates relative to the widget (usually `widget->window`).

    - Bin window coordinates: Coordinates relative to the window that GtkTreeView renders to.

    - Tree coordinates: Coordinates relative to the entire scrollable area of GtkTreeView. These
      coordinates start at (0, 0) for row 0 of the tree.

    Several functions are available for converting between the different
    coordinate systems.  The most common translations are between widget and bin
    window coordinates and between bin window and tree coordinates. For the
    former you can use [method@Gtk.TreeView.convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords]
    (and vice versa), for the latter [method@Gtk.TreeView.convert_bin_window_to_tree_coords]
    (and vice versa).

    ## `GtkTreeView` as `GtkBuildable`

    The `GtkTreeView` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface accepts
    [class@Gtk.TreeViewColumn] objects as `<child>` elements and exposes the
    internal [class@Gtk.TreeSelection] in UI definitions.

    An example of a UI definition fragment with `GtkTreeView`:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkTreeView" id="treeview">
      <property name="model">liststore1</property>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkTreeViewColumn" id="test-column">
          <property name="title">Test</property>
          <child>
            <object class="GtkCellRendererText" id="test-renderer"/>
            <attributes>
              <attribute name="text">1</attribute>
            </attributes>
          </child>
        </object>
      </child>
      <child internal-child="selection">
        <object class="GtkTreeSelection" id="selection">
          <signal name="changed" handler="on_treeview_selection_changed"/>
        </object>
      </child>
    </object>
    ```

    ## CSS nodes

    ```
    treeview.view
    ├── header
    │   ├── button
    │   │   ╰── [sort-indicator]
    ┊   ┊
    │   ╰── button
    │       ╰── [sort-indicator]
    │
    ├── [rubberband]
    ╰── [dndtarget]
    ```

    `GtkTreeView` has a main CSS node with name `treeview` and style class `.view`.
    It has a subnode with name `header`, which is the parent for all the column
    header widgets' CSS nodes.

    Each column header consists of a `button`, which among other content, has a
    child with name `sort-indicator`, which carries the `.ascending` or `.descending`
    style classes when the column header should show a sort indicator. The CSS
    is expected to provide a suitable image using the `-gtk-icon-source` property.

    For rubberband selection, a subnode with name `rubberband` is used.

    For the drop target location during DND, a subnode with name `dndtarget` is used.

    ### Height-for-width Geometry Management

    GTK uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management
    system. Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much
    vertical space it needs, depending on the amount of horizontal space
    that it is given (and similar for width-for-height). The most common
    example is a label that reflows to fill up the available width, wraps
    to fewer lines, and therefore needs less height.

    Height-for-width geometry management is implemented in GTK by way
    of two virtual methods:

    - [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.get_request_mode]
    - [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure]

    There are some important things to keep in mind when implementing
    height-for-width and when using it in widget implementations.

    If you implement a direct `GtkWidget` subclass that supports
    height-for-width or width-for-height geometry management for itself
    or its child widgets, the [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.get_request_mode] virtual
    function must be implemented as well and return the widget's preferred
    request mode. The default implementation of this virtual function
    returns %GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_CONSTANT_SIZE, which means that the widget will
    only ever get -1 passed as the for_size value to its
    [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure] implementation.

    The geometry management system will query a widget hierarchy in
    only one orientation at a time. When widgets are initially queried
    for their minimum sizes it is generally done in two initial passes
    in the [enum@Gtk.SizeRequestMode] chosen by the toplevel.

    For example, when queried in the normal %GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH mode:

    First, the default minimum and natural width for each widget
    in the interface will be computed using [method@Gtk.Widget.measure] with an
    orientation of %GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL and a for_size of -1.
    Because the preferred widths for each widget depend on the preferred
    widths of their children, this information propagates up the hierarchy,
    and finally a minimum and natural width is determined for the entire
    toplevel. Next, the toplevel will use the minimum width to query for the
    minimum height contextual to that width using [method@Gtk.Widget.measure] with an
    orientation of %GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL and a for_size of the just computed
    width. This will also be a highly recursive operation. The minimum height
    for the minimum width is normally used to set the minimum size constraint
    on the toplevel.

    After the toplevel window has initially requested its size in both
    dimensions it can go on to allocate itself a reasonable size (or a size
    previously specified with [method@Gtk.Window.set_default_size]). During the
    recursive allocation process it’s important to note that request cycles
    will be recursively executed while widgets allocate their children.
    Each widget, once allocated a size, will go on to first share the
    space in one orientation among its children and then request each child's
    height for its target allocated width or its width for allocated height,
    depending. In this way a widget will typically be requested its size
    a number of times before actually being allocated a size. The size a
    widget is finally allocated can of course differ from the size it has
    requested. For this reason, `GtkWidget` caches a  small number of results
    to avoid re-querying for the same sizes in one allocation cycle.

    If a widget does move content around to intelligently use up the
    allocated size then it must support the request in both
    `GtkSizeRequestMode`s even if the widget in question only
    trades sizes in a single orientation.

    For instance, a [class@Gtk.Label] that does height-for-width word wrapping
    will not expect to have [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure] with an orientation of
    %GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL called because that call is specific to a
    width-for-height request. In this case the label must return the height
    required for its own minimum possible width. By following this rule any
    widget that handles height-for-width or width-for-height requests will
    always be allocated at least enough space to fit its own content.

    Here are some examples of how a %GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH widget
    generally deals with width-for-height requests:

    ```c
    static void
    foo_widget_measure (GtkWidget      *widget,
                        GtkOrientation  orientation,
                        int             for_size,
                        int            *minimum_size,
                        int            *natural_size,
                        int            *minimum_baseline,
                        int            *natural_baseline)
    {
      if (orientation == GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL)
        {
          // Calculate minimum and natural width
        }
      else // VERTICAL
        {
          if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
            {
              int min_width, dummy;

              // First, get the minimum width of our widget
              GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->measure (widget, GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL, -1,
                                                      &min_width, &dummy, &dummy, &dummy);

              // Now use the minimum width to retrieve the minimum and natural height to display
              // that width.
              GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->measure (widget, GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, min_width,
                                                      minimum_size, natural_size, &dummy, &dummy);
            }
          else
            {
              // ... some widgets do both.
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Often a widget needs to get its own request during size request or
    allocation. For example, when computing height it may need to also
    compute width. Or when deciding how to use an allocation, the widget
    may need to know its natural size. In these cases, the widget should
    be careful to call its virtual methods directly, like in the code
    example above.

    It will not work to use the wrapper function [method@Gtk.Widget.measure]
    inside your own [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.size_allocate] implementation.
    These return a request adjusted by [class@Gtk.SizeGroup], the widget's
    align and expand flags, as well as its CSS style.

    If a widget used the wrappers inside its virtual method implementations,
    then the adjustments (such as widget margins) would be applied
    twice. GTK therefore does not allow this and will warn if you try
    to do it.

    Of course if you are getting the size request for another widget, such
    as a child widget, you must use [method@Gtk.Widget.measure]; otherwise, you
    would not properly consider widget margins, [class@Gtk.SizeGroup], and
    so forth.

    GTK also supports baseline vertical alignment of widgets. This
    means that widgets are positioned such that the typographical baseline of
    widgets in the same row are aligned. This happens if a widget supports
    baselines, has a vertical alignment using baselines, and is inside
    a widget that supports baselines and has a natural “row” that it aligns to
    the baseline, or a baseline assigned to it by the grandparent.

    Baseline alignment support for a widget is also done by the
    [vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure] virtual function. It allows you to report
    both a minimum and natural size.

    If a widget ends up baseline aligned it will be allocated all the space in
    the parent as if it was %GTK_ALIGN_FILL, but the selected baseline can be
    found via [method@Gtk.Widget.get_baseline]. If the baseline has a
    value other than -1 you need to align the widget such that the baseline
    appears at the position.

    ### GtkWidget as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkWidget` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface
    supports various custom elements to specify additional aspects of widgets
    that are not directly expressed as properties.

    If the widget uses a [class@Gtk.LayoutManager], `GtkWidget` supports
    a custom `<layout>` element, used to define layout properties:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkGrid" id="my_grid">
      <child>
        <object class="GtkLabel" id="label1">
          <property name="label">Description</property>
          <layout>
            <property name="column">0</property>
            <property name="row">0</property>
            <property name="row-span">1</property>
            <property name="column-span">1</property>
          </layout>
        </object>
      </child>

    `GtkWidget` allows style information such as style classes to
    be associated with widgets, using the custom `<style>` element:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
      <style>
        <class name="my-special-button-class"/>
        <class name="dark-button"/>
      </style>
    </object>
    ```

    `GtkWidget` allows defining accessibility information, such as properties,
    relations, and states, using the custom `<accessibility>` element:

    ```xml
    <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
      <accessibility>
        <property name="label">Download</property>
        <relation name="labelled-by">label1</relation>
      </accessibility>
    </object>
    ```

    ### Building composite widgets from template XML

    `GtkWidget `exposes some facilities to automate the procedure
    of creating composite widgets using "templates".

    To create composite widgets with `GtkBuilder` XML, one must associate
    the interface description with the widget class at class initialization
    time using [method@Gtk.WidgetClass.set_template].

    The interface description semantics expected in composite template descriptions
    is slightly different from regular [class@Gtk.Builder] XML.

    Unlike regular interface descriptions, [method@Gtk.WidgetClass.set_template]
    will expect a `<template>` tag as a direct child of the toplevel
    `<interface>` tag. The `<template>` tag must specify the “class” attribute
    which must be the type name of the widget. Optionally, the “parent”
    attribute may be specified to specify the direct parent type of the widget
    type; this is ignored by `GtkBuilder` but can be used by UI design tools to
    introspect what kind of properties and internal children exist for a given
    type when the actual type does not exist.

    The XML which is contained inside the `<template>` tag behaves as if it were
    added to the `<object>` tag defining the widget itself. You may set properties
    on a widget by inserting `<property>` tags into the `<template>` tag, and also
    add `<child>` tags to add children and extend a widget in the normal way you
    would with `<object>` tags.

    Additionally, `<object>` tags can also be added before and after the initial
    `<template>` tag in the normal way, allowing one to define auxiliary objects
    which might be referenced by other widgets declared as children of the
    `<template>` tag.

    Since, unlike the `<object>` tag, the `<template>` tag does not contain an
    “id” attribute, if you need to refer to the instance of the object itself that
    the template will create, simply refer to the template class name in an
    applicable element content.

    Here is an example of a template definition, which includes an example of
    this in the `<signal>` tag:

    ```xml
    <interface>
      <template class="FooWidget" parent="GtkBox">
        <property name="orientation">horizontal</property>
        <property name="spacing">4</property>
        <child>
          <object class="GtkButton" id="hello_button">
            <property name="label">Hello World</property>
            <signal name="clicked" handler="hello_button_clicked" object="FooWidget" swapped="yes"/>
          </object>
        </child>
        <child>
          <object class="GtkButton" id="goodbye_button">
            <property name="label">Goodbye World</property>
          </object>
        </child>
      </template>
    </interface>
    ```

    Typically, you'll place the template fragment into a file that is
    bundled with your project, using `GResource`. In order to load the
    template, you need to call [method@Gtk.WidgetClass.set_template_from_resource]
    from the class initialization of your `GtkWidget` type:

    ```c
    static void
    foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
    {
      // ...

      gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                   "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
    }
    ```

    You will also need to call [method@Gtk.Widget.init_template] from the
    instance initialization function:

    ```c
    static void
    foo_widget_init (FooWidget *self)
    {
      gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (self));

      // Initialize the rest of the widget...
    }
    ```

    as well as calling [method@Gtk.Widget.dispose_template] from the dispose
    function:

    ```c
    static void
    foo_widget_dispose (GObject *gobject)
    {
      FooWidget *self = FOO_WIDGET (gobject);

      // Dispose objects for which you have a reference...

      // Clear the template children for this widget type
      gtk_widget_dispose_template (GTK_WIDGET (self), FOO_TYPE_WIDGET);

      G_OBJECT_CLASS (foo_widget_parent_class)->dispose (gobject);
    }
    ```

    You can access widgets defined in the template using the
    [method@Gtk.Widget.get_template_child] function, but you will typically declare
    a pointer in the instance private data structure of your type using the same
    name as the widget in the template definition, and call
    [method@Gtk.WidgetClass.bind_template_child_full] (or one of its wrapper macros
    [func@Gtk.widget_class_bind_template_child] and [func@Gtk.widget_class_bind_template_child_private])
    with that name, e.g.

    ```c
    typedef struct {
      GtkWidget *hello_button;
      GtkWidget *goodbye_button;
    } FooWidgetPrivate;

    G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE (FooWidget, foo_widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)

    static void
    foo_widget_dispose (GObject *gobject)
    {
      gtk_widget_dispose_template (GTK_WIDGET (gobject), FOO_TYPE_WIDGET);

      G_OBJECT_CLASS (foo_widget_parent_class)->dispose (gobject);
    }

    static void
    foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
    {
      // ...
      G_OBJECT_CLASS (klass)->dispose = foo_widget_dispose;

      gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                   "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
      gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                    FooWidget, hello_button);
      gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                    FooWidget, goodbye_button);
    }

    static void
    foo_widget_init (FooWidget *widget)
    {
      gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (widget));
    }
    ```

    You can also use [method@Gtk.WidgetClass.bind_template_callback_full] (or
    is wrapper macro [func@Gtk.widget_class_bind_template_callback]) to connect
    a signal callback defined in the template with a function visible in the
    scope of the class, e.g.

    ```c
    // the signal handler has the instance and user data swapped
    // because of the swapped="yes" attribute in the template XML
    static void
    hello_button_clicked (FooWidget *self,
                          GtkButton *button)
    {
      g_print ("Hello, world!\\n");
    }

    static void
    foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
    {
      // ...
      gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                   "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
      gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass), hello_button_clicked);
    }
    ```

        Call this function to set the expand flag if you would like your
        widget to become larger horizontally when the window has extra

        By default, widgets automatically expand if any of their children

        Setting hexpand explicitly with this function will override the
        automatic expand behavior.

        This function forces the widget to expand or not to expand,
        regardless of children. The override occurs because
        [method@Gtk.Widget.set_hexpand] sets the hexpand-set property (see

        If hexpand is set, then it overrides any computed

        Opacity works on both toplevel widgets and child widgets, although
        there are some limitations: For toplevel widgets, applying opacity
        depends on the capabilities of the windowing system. On X11, this

        has been shown may cause some flicker.

        Note that the opacity is inherited through inclusion — if you set
        a toplevel to be partially translucent, all of its content will
        appear translucent, since it is ultimatively rendered on that
        toplevel. The opacity value itself is not inherited by child
        widgets (since that would make widgets deeper in the hierarchy
        progressively more translucent). As a consequence, [class@Gtk.Popover]

        Note the inherent danger of setting any fixed size - themes,
        translations into other languages, different fonts, and user action
        can all change the appropriate size for a given widget. So, it is
        basically impossible to hardcode a size that will always work.

        The size request of a widget is the smallest size a widget can
        accept while still functioning well and drawing itself correctly.

    Windows normally have decorations that are under the control
    of the windowing system and allow the user to manipulate the window
    (resize it, move it, close it,...).

    # GtkWindow as GtkBuildable

    The `GtkWindow` implementation of the [iface@Gtk.Buildable] interface supports
    setting a child as the titlebar by specifying “titlebar” as the “type”
    attribute of a `<child>` element.

    # Shortcuts and Gestures

    `GtkWindow` supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

    - <kbd>F10</kbd> activates the menubar, if present.
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd> makes the mnemonics visible while pressed.

    The following signals have default keybindings:

    - [signal@Gtk.Window::activate-default]
    - [signal@Gtk.Window::activate-focus]
    - [signal@Gtk.Window::enable-debugging]

    # Actions

    `GtkWindow` defines a set of built-in actions:

    - `default.activate` activates the default widget.
    - `window.minimize` minimizes the window.
    - `window.toggle-maximized` maximizes or restores the window.
    - `window.close` closes the window.

    # CSS nodes

    ```
    window.background [.csd / .solid-csd / .ssd] [.maximized / .fullscreen / .tiled]
    ├── <child>
    ╰── <titlebar child>.titlebar [.default-decoration]
    ```

    `GtkWindow` has a main CSS node with name window and style class .background.

    Style classes that are typically used with the main CSS node are .csd (when
    client-side decorations are in use), .solid-csd (for client-side decorations
    without invisible borders), .ssd (used by mutter when rendering server-side
    decorations). GtkWindow also represents window states with the following
    style classes on the main node: .maximized, .fullscreen, .tiled (when supported,
    also .tiled-top, .tiled-left, .tiled-right, .tiled-bottom).

    `GtkWindow` subclasses often add their own discriminating style classes,
    such as .dialog, .popup or .tooltip.

    Generally, some CSS properties don't make sense on the toplevel window node,
    such as margins or padding. When client-side decorations without invisible
    borders are in use (i.e. the .solid-csd style class is added to the
    main window node), the CSS border of the toplevel window is used for
    resize drags. In the .csd case, the shadow area outside of the window
    can be used to resize it.

    `GtkWindow` adds the .titlebar and .default-decoration style classes to the
    widget that is added as a titlebar child.

    # Accessibility
