def path_parse(

    """
    Constructs a path from a serialized form.

    The string is expected to be in (a superset of)
    [SVG path syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/paths.html#PathData),
    as e.g. produced by [method@Gsk.Path.to_string].

    A high-level summary of the syntax:

    - `M x y` Move to `(x, y)`
    - `L x y` Add a line from the current point to `(x, y)`
    - `Q x1 y1 x2 y2` Add a quadratic Bézier from the current point to `(x2, y2)`, with control point `(x1, y1)`
    - `C x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3` Add a cubic Bézier from the current point to `(x3, y3)`, with control points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`
    - `Z` Close the contour by drawing a line back to the start point
    - `H x` Add a horizontal line from the current point to the given x value
    - `V y` Add a vertical line from the current point to the given y value
    - `T x2 y2` Add a quadratic Bézier, using the reflection of the previous segments' control point as control point
    - `S x2 y2 x3 y3` Add a cubic Bézier, using the reflection of the previous segments' second control point as first control point
    - `A rx ry r l s x y` Add an elliptical arc from the current point to `(x, y)` with radii rx and ry. See the SVG documentation for how the other parameters influence the arc.
    - `O x1 y1 x2 y2 w` Add a rational quadratic Bézier from the current point to `(x2, y2)` with control point `(x1, y1)` and weight `w`.

    All the commands have lowercase variants that interpret coordinates
    relative to the current point.

    The `O` command is an extension that is not supported in SVG.

class GLShader(GObject.Object):
    """
    Implements a fragment shader using GLSL.

    A fragment shader gets the coordinates being rendered as input and
    produces the pixel values for that particular pixel. Additionally,
    the shader can declare a set of other input arguments, called
    uniforms (as they are uniform over all the calls to your shader in
    each instance of use). A shader can also receive up to 4
    textures that it can use as input when producing the pixel data.

    `GskGLShader` is usually used with gtk_snapshot_push_gl_shader()
    to produce a [class@Gsk.GLShaderNode] in the rendering hierarchy,
    and then its input textures are constructed by rendering the child
    nodes to textures before rendering the shader node itself. (You can
    pass texture nodes as children if you want to directly use a texture
    as input).

    The actual shader code is GLSL code that gets combined with
    some other code into the fragment shader. Since the exact
    capabilities of the GPU driver differs between different OpenGL
    drivers and hardware, GTK adds some defines that you can use
    to ensure your GLSL code runs on as many drivers as it can.

    If the OpenGL driver is GLES, then the shader language version
    is set to 100, and GSK_GLES will be defined in the shader.

    Otherwise, if the OpenGL driver does not support the 3.2 core profile,
    then the shader will run with language version 110 for GL2 and 130 for GL3,
    and GSK_LEGACY will be defined in the shader.

    If the OpenGL driver supports the 3.2 code profile, it will be used,
    the shader language version is set to 150, and GSK_GL3 will be defined
    in the shader.

    The main function the shader must implement is:

    ```glsl
     void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor,
                    in vec2 fragCoord,
                    in vec2 resolution,
                    in vec2 uv)
    ```

    Where the input @fragCoord is the coordinate of the pixel we're
    currently rendering, relative to the boundary rectangle that was
    specified in the `GskGLShaderNode`, and @resolution is the width and
    height of that rectangle. This is in the typical GTK coordinate
    system with the origin in the top left. @uv contains the u and v
    coordinates that can be used to index a texture at the
    corresponding point. These coordinates are in the [0..1]x[0..1]
    region, with 0, 0 being in the lower left corder (which is typical
    for OpenGL).

    The output @fragColor should be a RGBA color (with
    premultiplied alpha) that will be used as the output for the
    specified pixel location. Note that this output will be
    automatically clipped to the clip region of the glshader node.

    In addition to the function arguments the shader can define
    up to 4 uniforms for textures which must be called u_textureN
    (i.e. u_texture1 to u_texture4) as well as any custom uniforms
    you want of types int, uint, bool, float, vec2, vec3 or vec4.

    All textures sources contain premultiplied alpha colors, but if some
    there are outer sources of colors there is a gsk_premultiply() helper
    to compute premultiplication when needed.

    Note that GTK parses the uniform declarations, so each uniform has to
    be on a line by itself with no other code, like so:

    ```glsl
    uniform float u_time;
    uniform vec3 u_color;
    uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
    uniform sampler2D u_texture2;
    ```

    GTK uses the "gsk" namespace in the symbols it uses in the
    shader, so your code should not use any symbols with the prefix gsk
    or GSK. There are some helper functions declared that you can use:

    ```glsl
    vec4 GskTexture(sampler2D sampler, vec2 texCoords);
    ```

    This samples a texture (e.g. u_texture1) at the specified
    coordinates, and contains some helper ifdefs to ensure that
    it works on all OpenGL versions.

    You can compile the shader yourself using [method@Gsk.GLShader.compile],
    otherwise the GSK renderer will do it when it handling the glshader
    node. If errors occurs, the returned @error will include the glsl
    sources, so you can see what GSK was passing to the compiler. You
    can also set GSK_DEBUG=shaders in the environment to see the sources
    and other relevant information about all shaders that GSK is handling.

    # An example shader

    ```glsl
    uniform float position;
    uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
    uniform sampler2D u_texture2;

    void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor,
                   in vec2 fragCoord,
                   in vec2 resolution,
                   in vec2 uv) {
      vec4 source1 = GskTexture(u_texture1, uv);
      vec4 source2 = GskTexture(u_texture2, uv);

      fragColor = position * source1 + (1.0 - position) * source2;
    }
    ```
