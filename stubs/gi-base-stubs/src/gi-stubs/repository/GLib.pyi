    """
    Specifies a function to be called at normal program termination.

    Since GLib 2.8.2, on Windows `g_atexit` actually is a preprocessor
    macro that maps to a call to the `atexit` function in the C
    library. This means that in case the code that calls `g_atexit`,
    i.e. `atexit`, is in a DLL, the function will be called when the
    DLL is detached from the program. This typically makes more sense
    than that the function is called when the GLib DLL is detached,
    which happened earlier when `g_atexit` was a function in the GLib
    DLL.

    The behaviour of `atexit` in the context of dynamically loaded
    modules is not formally specified and varies wildly.

    On POSIX systems, calling `g_atexit` (or `atexit`) in a dynamically
    loaded module which is unloaded before the program terminates might
    well cause a crash at program exit.

    Some POSIX systems implement `atexit` like Windows, and have each
    dynamically loaded module maintain an own atexit chain that is
    called when the module is unloaded.

    On other POSIX systems, before a dynamically loaded module is
    unloaded, the registered atexit functions (if any) residing in that
    module are called, regardless where the code that registered them
    resided. This is presumably the most robust approach.

    As can be seen from the above, for portability it's best to avoid
    calling `g_atexit` (or `atexit`) except in the main executable of a
    program.

    * the application must not call `waitpid` with a non-positive
      first argument, for instance in another thread
    * the application must not wait for `pid` to exit by any other
      mechanism, including `waitpid(pid, ...)` or a second child-watch
      source for the same `pid`
    * the application must not ignore `SIGCHLD`
    * Before 2.78, the application could not send a signal (``kill``) to the
      watched `pid` in a race free manner. Since 2.78, you can do that while the
      associated [struct`GLib`.MainContext] is acquired.
    * Before 2.78, even after destroying the [struct`GLib`.Source], you could not
      be sure that `pid` wasn't already reaped. Hence, it was also not
      safe to ``kill`` or ``waitpid`` on the process ID after the child watch
      source was gone. Destroying the source before it fired made it
      impossible to reliably reap the process.

    If any of those conditions are not met, this and related APIs will
    not work correctly. This can often be diagnosed via a GLib warning
    stating that `ECHILD` was received by `waitpid`.

    Calling `waitpid` for specific processes other than `pid` remains a
    valid thing to do.

    Writes all of `contents` to a file named `filename`, with good error checking.

    `flags` control the properties of the write operation: whether it’s atomic,
    and what the tradeoff is between returning quickly or being resilient to
    system crashes.

    As this function performs file I/O, it is recommended to not call it anywhere
    where blocking would cause problems, such as in the main loop of a graphical
    application. In particular, if `flags` has any value other than
    G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_NONE then this function may call ``fsync``.

    If G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT is set in `flags`, the operation is atomic
    in the sense that it is first written to a temporary file which is then
    renamed to the final name.

    Notes:

    - On UNIX, if `filename` already exists hard links to `filename` will break.
      Also since the file is recreated, existing permissions, access control
      lists, metadata etc. may be lost. If `filename` is a symbolic link,
      the link itself will be replaced, not the linked file.

    - On UNIX, if `filename` already exists and is non-empty, and if the system
      supports it (via a journalling filesystem or equivalent), and if
      G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT is set in `flags`, the ``fsync`` call (or
      equivalent) will be used to ensure atomic replacement: `filename`
      will contain either its old contents or `contents`, even in the face of
      system power loss, the disk being unsafely removed, etc.

    - On UNIX, if `filename` does not already exist or is empty, there is a
      possibility that system power loss etc. after calling this function will
      leave `filename` empty or full of NUL bytes, depending on the underlying
      filesystem, unless G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_DURABLE and
      G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT are set in `flags`.

    - On Windows renaming a file will not remove an existing file with the
      new name, so on Windows there is a race condition between the existing
      file being removed and the temporary file being renamed.

    - On Windows there is no way to remove a file that is open to some
      process, or mapped into memory. Thus, this function will fail if
      `filename` already exists and is open.

    If the call was successful, it returns True. If the call was not successful,
    it returns False and sets `error`. The error domain is G_FILE_ERROR.
    Possible error codes are those in the GFileError enumeration.

    Note that the name for the temporary file is constructed by appending up
    to 7 characters to `filename`.

    If the file didn’t exist before and is created, it will be given the
    permissions from `mode`. Otherwise, the permissions of the existing file may
    be changed to `mode` depending on `flags`, or they may remain unchanged.

    directory doesn't matter since the existence test is True. With
    the current set of available tests, there's no point passing in
    more than one test at a time.

    Apart from G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK all tests follow symbolic links,
    so for a symbolic link to a regular file `g_file_test` will return
    True for both G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK and G_FILE_TEST_IS_REGULAR.

    Note, that for a dangling symbolic link `g_file_test` will return
    True for G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK and False for all other flags.

    You should never use `g_file_test` to test whether it is safe

    of the condition changing before you actually perform the operation,
    see [TOCTOU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use).

    For example, you might think you could use G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK

    tricked into writing into a different location. It doesn't work!

    Another thing to note is that G_FILE_TEST_EXISTS and
    G_FILE_TEST_IS_EXECUTABLE are implemented using the `access`
    system call. This usually doesn't matter, but if your program
    is setuid or setgid it means that these tests will give you
    the answer for the real user ID and group ID, rather than the
    effective user ID and group ID.

    On Windows, there are no symlinks, so testing for
    G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK will always return False. Testing for
    G_FILE_TEST_IS_EXECUTABLE will just check that the file exists and
    its name indicates that it is executable, checking for well-known

    subsequent character sets are used when trying to generate a displayable
    representation of a filename, see `g_filename_display_name`.

    On Unix, the character sets are determined by consulting the
    environment variables `G_FILENAME_ENCODING` and `G_BROKEN_FILENAMES`.
    On Windows, the character set used in the GLib API is always UTF-8
    and said environment variables have no effect.

    `G_FILENAME_ENCODING` may be set to a comma-separated list of
    character set names. The special token ``locale`` is taken to mean the
    character set for the [current locale](running.html#locale).
    If `G_FILENAME_ENCODING` is not set, but `G_BROKEN_FILENAMES` is,
    the character set of the current locale is taken as the filename
    encoding. If neither environment variable  is set, UTF-8 is taken
    as the filename encoding, but the character set of the current locale
    is also put in the list of encodings.

    The returned `charsets` belong to GLib and must not be freed.

    Note that on Unix, regardless of the locale character set or
    `G_FILENAME_ENCODING` value, the actual file names present
    on a system might be in any random encoding or just gibberish.

    If the path given in `HOME` is non-absolute, does not exist, or is

    If your program has a strong requirement for either the new or the

    This works from an application, however, if you want to do the same
    thing from a library, it gets more difficult, since you no longer
    control the main loop. You might think you can simply use an idle
    function to make the call to `free_allocated_memory`, but that
    doesn't work, since the idle function could be called from a
    recursive callback. This can be fixed by using [func`GLib`.main_depth]

    |[<!-- language="C" -->
    gpointer
    allocate_memory (gsize size)
    {
      FreeListBlock *block = g_new (FreeListBlock, 1);

      block->depth = g_main_depth ();
      free_list = g_list_prepend (free_list, block);
      return block->mem;

    free_allocated_memory (void)

          FreeListBlock *block = l->data;

            {
              g_free (block->mem);
              g_free (block);
              free_list = g_list_delete_link (free_list, l);
            }

          l = next;
        }
      }
    ]|

    There is a temptation to use [func`GLib`.main_depth] to solve
    problems with reentrancy. For instance, while waiting for data
    to be received from the network in response to a menu item,
    the menu item might be selected again. It might seem that
    one could make the menu item's callback return immediately
    and do nothing if [func`GLib`.main_depth] returns a value greater than 1.
    However, this should be avoided since the user then sees selecting
    the menu item do nothing. Furthermore, you'll find yourself adding
    these checks all over your code, since there are doubtless many,
    many things that the user could do. Instead, you can use the
    following techniques:

    1. Use `gtk_widget_set_sensitive` or modal dialogs to prevent
       the user from interacting with elements while the main
       loop is recursing.

    2. Avoid main loop recursion in situations where you can't handle
       arbitrary  callbacks. Instead, structure your code so that you
       simply return to the main loop and then get called again when
       there is more work to do.

    """
    Executes a child program asynchronously (your program will not
    block waiting for the child to exit).

    The child program is specified by the only argument that must be
    provided, `argv`. `argv` should be a None-terminated array of strings,
    to be passed as the argument vector for the child. The first string
    in `argv` is of course the name of the program to execute. By default,
    the name of the program must be a full path. If `flags` contains the
    G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH flag, the `PATH` environment variable is used to
    search for the executable. If `flags` contains the
    G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP flag, the `PATH` variable from `envp`
    is used to search for the executable. If both the
    G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH and G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP flags are
    set, the `PATH` variable from `envp` takes precedence over the
    environment variable.

    If the program name is not a full path and G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH flag
    is not used, then the program will be run from the current directory
    (or `working_directory`, if specified); this might be unexpected or even
    dangerous in some cases when the current directory is world-writable.

    On Windows, note that all the string or string vector arguments to
    this function and the other `g_spawn*()` functions are in UTF-8, the
    GLib file name encoding. Unicode characters that are not part of
    the system codepage passed in these arguments will be correctly
    available in the spawned program only if it uses wide character API
    to retrieve its command line. For C programs built with Microsoft's
    tools it is enough to make the program have a ``wmain`` instead of
    ``main``. ``wmain`` has a wide character argument vector as parameter.

    At least currently, mingw doesn't support ``wmain``, so if you use
    mingw to develop the spawned program, it should call
    `g_win32_get_command_line` to get arguments in UTF-8.

    On Windows the low-level child process creation API ``CreateProcess``
    doesn't use argument vectors, but a command line. The C runtime
    library's `spawn*()` family of functions (which `g_spawn_async_with_pipes`
    eventually calls) paste the argument vector elements together into
    a command line, and the C runtime startup code does a corresponding
    reconstruction of an argument vector from the command line, to be
    passed to ``main``. Complications arise when you have argument vector
    elements that contain spaces or double quotes. The `spawn*()` functions
    don't do any quoting or escaping, but on the other hand the startup
    code does do unquoting and unescaping in order to enable receiving
    arguments with embedded spaces or double quotes. To work around this
    asymmetry, `g_spawn_async_with_pipes` will do quoting and escaping on
    argument vector elements that need it before calling the C runtime
    ``spawn`` function.

    The returned `child_pid` on Windows is a handle to the child
    process, not its identifier. Process handles and process
    identifiers are different concepts on Windows.

    `envp` is a None-terminated array of strings, where each string
    has the form `KEY=VALUE`. This will become the child's environment.
    If `envp` is None, the child inherits its parent's environment.

    `flags` should be the bitwise OR of any flags you want to affect the
    function's behaviour. The G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD means that the
    child will not automatically be reaped; you must use a child watch
    (`g_child_watch_add`) to be notified about the death of the child process,
    otherwise it will stay around as a zombie process until this process exits.
    Eventually you must call `g_spawn_close_pid` on the `child_pid`, in order to
    free resources which may be associated with the child process. (On Unix,
    using a child watch is equivalent to calling `waitpid` or handling
    the `SIGCHLD` signal manually. On Windows, calling `g_spawn_close_pid`
    is equivalent to calling ``CloseHandle`` on the process handle returned
    in `child_pid`). See `g_child_watch_add`.

    Open UNIX file descriptors marked as `FD_CLOEXEC` will be automatically
    closed in the child process. G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN means that
    other open file descriptors will be inherited by the child; otherwise all
    descriptors except stdin/stdout/stderr will be closed before calling ``exec``
    in the child. G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH means that `argv`[0] need not be an
    absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` environment
    variable. G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP means need not be an
    absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` variable from
    `envp`. If both G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH and G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP
    are used, the value from `envp` takes precedence over the environment.

    G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN means that the child will inherit the parent's
    standard input (by default, the child's standard input is attached to
    `/dev/null`). G_SPAWN_STDIN_FROM_DEV_NULL explicitly imposes the default
    behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in both cases,
    the `stdin_pipe_out` argument is ignored.

    G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL means that the child's standard output
    will be discarded (by default, it goes to the same location as the parent's
    standard output). G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDOUT explicitly imposes the
    default behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in
    both cases, the `stdout_pipe_out` argument is ignored.

    G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL means that the child's standard error
    will be discarded (by default, it goes to the same location as the parent's
    standard error). G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDERR explicitly imposes the
    default behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in
    both cases, the `stderr_pipe_out` argument is ignored.

    It is valid to pass the same FD in multiple parameters (e.g. you can pass
    a single FD for both `stdout_fd` and `stderr_fd`, and include it in
    `source_fds` too).

    `source_fds` and `target_fds` allow zero or more FDs from this process to be
    remapped to different FDs in the spawned process. If `n_fds` is greater than
    zero, `source_fds` and `target_fds` must both be non-None and the same length.
    Each FD in `source_fds` is remapped to the FD number at the same index in
    `target_fds`. The source and target FD may be equal to simply propagate an FD
    to the spawned process. FD remappings are processed after standard FDs, so
    any target FDs which equal `stdin_fd`, `stdout_fd` or `stderr_fd` will overwrite
    them in the spawned process.

    `source_fds` is supported on Windows since 2.72.

    G_SPAWN_FILE_AND_ARGV_ZERO means that the first element of `argv` is
    the file to execute, while the remaining elements are the actual
    argument vector to pass to the file. Normally `g_spawn_async_with_pipes`
    uses `argv`[0] as the file to execute, and passes all of `argv` to the child.

    `child_setup` and `user_data` are a function and user data. On POSIX
    platforms, the function is called in the child after GLib has
    performed all the setup it plans to perform (including creating
    pipes, closing file descriptors, etc.) but before calling ``exec``.
    That is, `child_setup` is called just before calling ``exec`` in the
    child. Obviously actions taken in this function will only affect
    the child, not the parent.

    On Windows, there is no separate ``fork`` and ``exec`` functionality.
    Child processes are created and run with a single API call,
    ``CreateProcess``. There is no sensible thing `child_setup`
    could be used for on Windows so it is ignored and not called.

    If non-None, `child_pid` will on Unix be filled with the child's
    process ID. You can use the process ID to send signals to the child,
    or to use `g_child_watch_add` (or ``waitpid``) if you specified the
    G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag. On Windows, `child_pid` will be
    filled with a handle to the child process only if you specified the
    G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag. You can then access the child
    process using the Win32 API, for example wait for its termination
    with the `WaitFor*()` functions, or examine its exit code with
    ``GetExitCodeProcess``. You should close the handle with ``CloseHandle``
    or `g_spawn_close_pid` when you no longer need it.

    If non-None, the `stdin_pipe_out`, `stdout_pipe_out`, `stderr_pipe_out`
    locations will be filled with file descriptors for writing to the child's
    standard input or reading from its standard output or standard error.
    The caller of `g_spawn_async_with_pipes` must close these file descriptors
    when they are no longer in use. If these parameters are None, the
    corresponding pipe won't be created.

    If `stdin_pipe_out` is None, the child's standard input is attached to
    `/dev/null` unless G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN is set.

    If `stderr_pipe_out` is None, the child's standard error goes to the same
    location as the parent's standard error unless G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL
    is set.

    If `stdout_pipe_out` is None, the child's standard output goes to the same
    location as the parent's standard output unless G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL
    is set.

    `error` can be None to ignore errors, or non-None to report errors.
    If an error is set, the function returns False. Errors are reported
    even if they occur in the child (for example if the executable in
    ``argv`[0]` is not found). Typically the `message` field of returned
    errors should be displayed to users. Possible errors are those from
    the G_SPAWN_ERROR domain.

    If an error occurs, `child_pid`, `stdin_pipe_out`, `stdout_pipe_out`,
    and `stderr_pipe_out` will not be filled with valid values.

    If `child_pid` is not None and an error does not occur then the returned
    process reference must be closed using `g_spawn_close_pid`.

    On modern UNIX platforms, GLib can use an efficient process launching
    codepath driven internally by ``posix_spawn``. This has the advantage of
    avoiding the fork-time performance costs of cloning the parent process
    address space, and avoiding associated memory overcommit checks that are
    not relevant in the context of immediately executing a distinct process.
    This optimized codepath will be used provided that the following conditions
    are met:

    1. G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD is set
    2. G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN is set
    3. G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP is not set
    4. `working_directory` is None
    5. `child_setup` is None
    6. The program is of a recognised binary format, or has a shebang.
       Otherwise, GLib will have to execute the program through the
       shell, which is not done using the optimized codepath.

    If you are writing a GTK application, and the program you are spawning is a
    graphical application too, then to ensure that the spawned program opens its
    windows on the right screen, you may want to use GdkAppLaunchContext,
    GAppLaunchContext, or set the `DISPLAY` environment variable.

    as returned by `g_spawn_sync`, `g_subprocess_get_status`, ``waitpid``,
    etc. On Unix platforms, it is incorrect for it to be the exit status
    as passed to ``exit`` or returned by `g_subprocess_get_exit_status` or
    ``WEXITSTATUS``.

@staticmethod
def spawn_check_wait_status(
    wait_status: int,
) -> bool:
    """
    Set `error` if `wait_status` indicates the child exited abnormally
    (e.g. with a nonzero exit code, or via a fatal signal).

    The `g_spawn_sync` and `g_child_watch_add` family of APIs return the
    status of subprocesses encoded in a platform-specific way.
    On Unix, this is guaranteed to be in the same format `waitpid` returns,
    and on Windows it is guaranteed to be the result of `GetExitCodeProcess`.

    Prior to the introduction of this function in GLib 2.34, interpreting
    `wait_status` required use of platform-specific APIs, which is problematic
    for software using GLib as a cross-platform layer.

    Additionally, many programs simply want to determine whether or not
    the child exited successfully, and either propagate a GError or
    print a message to standard error. In that common case, this function
    can be used. Note that the error message in `error` will contain
    human-readable information about the wait status.

    The `domain` and `code` of `error` have special semantics in the case
    where the process has an "exit code", as opposed to being killed by
    a signal. On Unix, this happens if `WIFEXITED` would be true of
    `wait_status`. On Windows, it is always the case.

    The special semantics are that the actual exit code will be the
    code set in `error`, and the domain will be G_SPAWN_EXIT_ERROR.
    This allows you to differentiate between different exit codes.

    If the process was terminated by some means other than an exit
    status (for example if it was killed by a signal), the domain will be
    G_SPAWN_ERROR and the code will be G_SPAWN_ERROR_FAILED.

    This function just offers convenience; you can of course also check
    the available platform via a macro such as G_OS_UNIX, and use
    `WIFEXITED` and `WEXITSTATUS` on `wait_status` directly. Do not attempt
    to scan or parse the error message string; it may be translated and/or
    change in future versions of GLib.

    A simple reference counted data type representing an immutable sequence of

    alive for as long as anyone holds a reference to the bytes.  When
    the last reference count is dropped, the memory is released. Multiple
    unrelated callers can use byte data in the `GBytes` without coordinating
    their activities, resting assured that the byte data will not change or
    move while they hold a reference.

    A `GBytes` can come from many different origins that may have
    different procedures for freeing the memory region.  Examples are
    memory from [func`GLib`.malloc], from memory slices, from a
    [struct`GLib`.MappedFile] or memory from other allocators.

    `GBytes` work well as keys in [struct`GLib`.HashTable]. Use

class Cond(GObject.GPointer):
    """
    The GCond struct is an opaque data structure that represents a
    condition. Threads can block on a GCond if they find a certain
    condition to be false. If other threads change the state of this
    condition they signal the GCond, and that causes the waiting
    threads to be woken up.

    Consider the following example of a shared variable.  One or more
    threads can wait for data to be published to the variable and when
    another thread publishes the data, it can signal one of the waiting
    threads to wake up to collect the data.

    Here is an example for using GCond to block a thread until a condition
    is satisfied:
    |[<!-- language="C" -->
      gpointer current_data = None;
      GMutex data_mutex;
      GCond data_cond;

      void
      push_data (gpointer data)
      {
        g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
        current_data = data;
        g_cond_signal (&data_cond);
        g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
      }

      gpointer
      pop_data (void)
      {
        gpointer data;

        g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
        while (!current_data)
          g_cond_wait (&data_cond, &data_mutex);
        data = current_data;
        current_data = None;
        g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);

        return data;
      }
    ]|
    Whenever a thread calls `pop_data` now, it will wait until
    current_data is non-None, i.e. until some other thread
    has called `push_data`.

    The example shows that use of a condition variable must always be
    paired with a mutex.  Without the use of a mutex, there would be a
    race between the check of `current_data` by the while loop in
    `pop_data` and waiting. Specifically, another thread could set
    `current_data` after the check, and signal the cond (with nobody
    waiting on it) before the first thread goes to sleep. GCond is
    specifically useful for its ability to release the mutex and go
    to sleep atomically.

    It is also important to use the `g_cond_wait` and `g_cond_wait_until`
    functions only inside a loop which checks for the condition to be
    true.  See `g_cond_wait` for an explanation of why the condition may
    not be true even after it returns.

    If a GCond is allocated in static storage then it can be used
    without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call `g_cond_init`
    on it and `g_cond_clear` when done.

    A GCond should only be accessed via the g_cond_ functions.

        This is when `g_cond_signal` is called, but another thread acquires
        `mutex` before this thread and modifies the state of the program in
        such a way that when `g_cond_wait` is able to return, the expected
        condition is no longer met.

        For this reason, `g_cond_wait` must always be used in a loop.  See

        As with `g_cond_wait` it is possible that a spurious or stolen wakeup
        could occur.  For that reason, waiting on a condition variable should
        always be in a loop, based on an explicitly-checked predicate.

        True is returned if the condition variable was signalled (or in the
        case of a spurious wakeup).  False is returned if `end_time` has
        passed.

        The following code shows how to correctly perform a timed wait on a
        condition variable (extending the example presented in the
        documentation for GCond):

        |[<!-- language="C" -->

        Notice that the end time is calculated once, before entering the
        loop and reused.  This is the motivation behind the use of absolute
        time on this API -- if a relative time of 5 seconds were passed
        directly to the call and a spurious wakeup occurred, the program would
        have to start over waiting again (which would lead to a total wait
        time of more than 5 seconds).

    `GDateTime` is a structure that combines a Gregorian date and time
    into a single structure.

    `GDateTime` provides many conversion and methods to manipulate dates and times.
    Time precision is provided down to microseconds and the time can range
    (proleptically) from 0001-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999.
    `GDateTime` follows POSIX time in the sense that it is oblivious to leap
    seconds.

    `GDateTime` is an immutable object; once it has been created it cannot
    be modified further. All modifiers will create a new `GDateTime`.
    Nearly all such functions can fail due to the date or time going out
    of range, in which case None will be returned.

    `GDateTime` is reference counted: the reference count is increased by calling
    [method`GLib`.DateTime.ref] and decreased by calling [method`GLib`.DateTime.unref].
    When the reference count drops to 0, the resources allocated by the `GDateTime`
    structure are released.

    Many parts of the API may produce non-obvious results. As an
    example, adding two months to January 31st will yield March 31st
    whereas adding one month and then one month again will yield either
    March 28th or March 29th.  Also note that adding 24 hours is not

        `0`, `_` and `-` modifiers. The Python extension `%f` is also supported.

        In contrast to ``strftime``, this function always produces a UTF-8
        string, regardless of the current locale.  Note that the rendering of
        many formats is locale-dependent and may not match the ``strftime``
        output exactly.

        The following format specifiers are supported:

        - `%a`: the abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale
        - `A`: the full weekday name according to the current locale
        - `%b`: the abbreviated month name according to the current locale
        - `B`: the full month name according to the current locale
        - `%c`: the preferred date and time representation for the current locale
        - `C`: the century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer (00-99)
        - `%d`: the day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31)
        - `%e`: the day of the month as a decimal number (range 1 to 31);
          single digits are preceded by a figure space (U+2007)
        - `F`: equivalent to `Y-%m-%d` (the ISO 8601 date format)
        - `%g`: the last two digits of the ISO 8601 week-based year as a
          decimal number (00-99). This works well with `V` and `%u`.
        - `G`: the ISO 8601 week-based year as a decimal number. This works
          well with `V` and `%u`.
        - `%h`: equivalent to `%b`
        - `H`: the hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23)
        - `I`: the hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12)
        - `%j`: the day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366)
        - `%k`: the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23);
          single digits are preceded by a figure space (U+2007)
        - `%l`: the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12);
          single digits are preceded by a figure space (U+2007)
        - `%m`: the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12)
        - `M`: the minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59)
        - `%f`: the microsecond as a decimal number (range 000000 to 999999)
        - `%p`: either ‘AM’ or ‘PM’ according to the given time value, or the
          corresponding  strings for the current locale.  Noon is treated as
          ‘PM’ and midnight as ‘AM’. Use of this format specifier is discouraged, as
          many locales have no concept of AM/PM formatting. Use `%c` or `X` instead.
        - `P`: like `%p` but lowercase: ‘am’ or ‘pm’ or a corresponding string for
          the current locale. Use of this format specifier is discouraged, as
          many locales have no concept of AM/PM formatting. Use `%c` or `X` instead.
        - `%r`: the time in a.m. or p.m. notation. Use of this format specifier is
          discouraged, as many locales have no concept of AM/PM formatting. Use `%c`
          or `X` instead.
        - `R`: the time in 24-hour notation (`H:M`)
        - `%s`: the number of seconds since the Epoch, that is, since 1970-01-01
          00:00:00 UTC
        - `S`: the second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60)
        - `%t`: a tab character
        - `T`: the time in 24-hour notation with seconds (`H:M:S`)
        - `%u`: the ISO 8601 standard day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7,
           Monday being 1. This works well with `G` and `V`.
        - `V`: the ISO 8601 standard week number of the current year as a decimal
          number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at
          least 4 days in the new year. See `g_date_time_get_week_of_year`.
          This works well with `G` and `%u`.
        - `%w`: the day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0.
          This is not the ISO 8601 standard format — use `%u` instead.
        - `%x`: the preferred date representation for the current locale without
          the time
        - `X`: the preferred time representation for the current locale without
          the date
        - `%y`: the year as a decimal number without the century

        Some conversion specifications can be modified by preceding the
        conversion specifier by one or more modifier characters.

        The following modifiers are supported for many of the numeric
        conversions:

        - `O`: Use alternative numeric symbols, if the current locale supports those.
        - `_`: Pad a numeric result with spaces. This overrides the default padding
          for the specifier.
        - `-`: Do not pad a numeric result. This overrides the default padding
          for the specifier.
        - `0`: Pad a numeric result with zeros. This overrides the default padding
          for the specifier.

        The following modifiers are supported for many of the alphabetic conversions:

        - `^`: Use upper case if possible. This is a gnulib ``strftime`` extension.
          Since: 2.80
        - `#`: Use opposite case if possible. This is a gnulib ``strftime``
          extension. Since: 2.80

        Additionally, when `O` is used with `B`, `b`, or `h`, it produces the alternative
        form of a month name. The alternative form should be used when the month
        name is used without a day number (e.g., standalone). It is required in
        some languages (Baltic, Slavic, Greek, and more) due to their grammatical
        rules. For other languages there is no difference. `OB` is a GNU and BSD
        ``strftime`` extension expected to be added to the future POSIX specification,
        `Ob` and `Oh` are GNU ``strftime`` extensions. Since: 2.56

        Since GLib 2.80, when `E` is used with `%c`, `C`, `%x`, `X`, `%y` or `Y`,
        the date is formatted using an alternate era representation specific to the
        locale. This is typically used for the Thai solar calendar or Japanese era
        names, for example.

        - `Ec`: the preferred date and time representation for the current locale,
          using the alternate era representation
        - `EC`: the name of the era
        - `Ex`: the preferred date representation for the current locale without
          the time, using the alternate era representation
        - `EX`: the preferred time representation for the current locale without
          the date, using the alternate era representation
        - `Ey`: the year since the beginning of the era denoted by the `EC`
          specifier
        - `EY`: the full alternative year representation

class IOChannel(GObject.GBoxed):

    The `GIOChannel` data type aims to provide a portable method for
    using file descriptors, pipes, and sockets, and integrating them
    into the main event loop (see [struct`GLib`.MainContext]). Currently,
    full support is available on UNIX platforms; support for Windows
    is only partially complete.

    To create a new `GIOChannel` on UNIX systems use
    [ctor`GLib`.IOChannel.unix_new]. This works for plain file descriptors,
    pipes and sockets. Alternatively, a channel can be created for a
    file in a system independent manner using [ctor`GLib`.IOChannel.new_file].

    Once a `GIOChannel` has been created, it can be used in a generic
    manner with the functions [method`GLib`.IOChannel.read_chars],
    [method`GLib`.IOChannel.write_chars], [method`GLib`.IOChannel.seek_position],
    and [method`GLib`.IOChannel.shutdown].

    To add a `GIOChannel` to the main event loop, use [func`GLib`.io_add_watch] or
    [func`GLib`.io_add_watch_full]. Here you specify which events you are
    interested in on the `GIOChannel`, and provide a function to be called
    whenever these events occur.

    `GIOChannel` instances are created with an initial reference count of 1.
    [method`GLib`.IOChannel.ref] and [method`GLib`.IOChannel.unref] can be used to
    increment or decrement the reference count respectively. When the
    reference count falls to 0, the `GIOChannel` is freed. (Though it
    isn’t closed automatically, unless it was created using
    [ctor`GLib`.IOChannel.new_file].) Using [func`GLib`.io_add_watch] or
    [func`GLib`.io_add_watch_full] increments a channel’s reference count.

    The new functions [method`GLib`.IOChannel.read_chars],
    [method`GLib`.IOChannel.read_line], [method`GLib`.IOChannel.read_line_string],
    [method`GLib`.IOChannel.read_to_end], [method`GLib`.IOChannel.write_chars],
    [method`GLib`.IOChannel.seek_position], and [method`GLib`.IOChannel.flush]
    should not be mixed with the deprecated functions
    [method`GLib`.IOChannel.read], [method`GLib`.IOChannel.write], and
    [method`GLib`.IOChannel.seek] on the same channel.

          internal buffers.)

        - The current encoding is None or UTF-8.

class KeyFile(GObject.GBoxed):
    """
    `GKeyFile` parses .ini-like config files.

    `GKeyFile` lets you parse, edit or create files containing groups of
    key-value pairs, which we call ‘key files’ for lack of a better name.
    Several freedesktop.org specifications use key files. For example, the
    [Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/)
    and the [Icon Theme Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/latest/).

    The syntax of key files is described in detail in the
    [Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/),
    here is a quick summary: Key files consists of groups of key-value pairs, interspersed
    with comments.

    ```txt
    # this is just an example
    # there can be comments before the first group

    [First Group]

    Name=Key File Example\\tthis value shows\\nescaping

    # localized strings are stored in multiple key-value pairs
    Welcome=Hello
    Welcome[de]=Hallo
    Welcome[fr_FR]=Bonjour
    Welcome[it]=Ciao

    [Another Group]

    Numbers=2;20;-200;0

    Booleans=true;false;true;true
    ```

    Lines beginning with a `#` and blank lines are considered comments.

    Groups are started by a header line containing the group name enclosed
    in `[` and `]`, and ended implicitly by the start of the next group or
    the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a group.

    Key-value pairs generally have the form `key=value`, with the exception
    of localized strings, which have the form `key[locale]=value`, with a
    locale identifier of the form `lang_COUNTRY`MODIFIER`` where `COUNTRY`
    and `MODIFIER` are optional. As a special case, the locale `C` is associated
    with the untranslated pair `key=value` (since GLib 2.84). Space before and
    after the `=` character is ignored. Newline, tab, carriage return and
    backslash characters in value are escaped as `\\n`, `\\t`, `\\r`, and `\\\\\\`,
    respectively. To preserve leading spaces in values, these can also be escaped
    as `\\s`.

    Key files can store strings (possibly with localized variants), integers,
    booleans and lists of these. Lists are separated by a separator character,
    typically `;` or `,`. To use the list separator character in a value in
    a list, it has to be escaped by prefixing it with a backslash.

    This syntax is obviously inspired by the .ini files commonly met
    on Windows, but there are some important differences:

    - .ini files use the `;` character to begin comments,
      key files use the `#` character.

    - Key files do not allow for ungrouped keys meaning only
      comments can precede the first group.

    - Key files are always encoded in UTF-8.

    - Key and Group names are case-sensitive. For example, a group called
      `[GROUP]` is a different from `[group]`.

    - .ini files don’t have a strongly typed boolean entry type,
       they only have ``GetProfileInt``. In key files, only
       `true` and `false` (in lower case) are allowed.

    Note that in contrast to the
    [Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/),
    groups in key files may contain the same key multiple times; the last entry wins.
    Key files may also contain multiple groups with the same name; they are merged
    together. Another difference is that keys and group names in key files are not
    restricted to ASCII characters.

    Here is an example of loading a key file and reading a value:

    ```c
    g_autoptr(GError) error = None;
    g_autoptr(GKeyFile) key_file = g_key_file_new ();

    if (!g_key_file_load_from_file (key_file, "key-file.ini", flags, &error))
      {
        if (!g_error_matches (error, G_FILE_ERROR, G_FILE_ERROR_NOENT))
          g_warning ("Error loading key file: %s", error->message);
        return;
      }

    g_autofree gchar *val = g_key_file_get_string (key_file, "Group Name", "SomeKey", &error);
    if (val == None &&
        !g_error_matches (error, G_KEY_FILE_ERROR, G_KEY_FILE_ERROR_KEY_NOT_FOUND))
      {
        g_warning ("Error finding key in key file: %s", error->message);
        return;
      }
    else if (val == None)
      {
        // Fall back to a default value.
        val = g_strdup ("default-value");
      }
    ```

    Here is an example of creating and saving a key file:

    ```c
    g_autoptr(GKeyFile) key_file = g_key_file_new ();
    const gchar *val = …;
    g_autoptr(GError) error = None;

    g_key_file_set_string (key_file, "Group Name", "SomeKey", val);

    // Save as a file.
    if (!g_key_file_save_to_file (key_file, "key-file.ini", &error))
      {
        g_warning ("Error saving key file: %s", error->message);
        return;
      }

    // Or store to a GBytes for use elsewhere.
    gsize data_len;
    g_autofree guint8 *data = (guint8 *) g_key_file_to_data (key_file, &data_len, &error);
    if (data == None)
      {
        g_warning ("Error saving key file: %s", error->message);
        return;

            Acquires `context` and sets it as the thread-default context for the

        (such as most [Gio](../gio/index.html)-based I/O) which are
        started in this thread to run under `context` and deliver their
        results to its main loop, rather than running under the global
        default main context in the main thread. Note that calling this function
        changes the context returned by [func`GLib`.MainContext.get_thread_default],
        not the one returned by [func`GLib`.MainContext.default], so it does not
        affect the context used by functions like [func`GLib`.idle_add].

        Normally you would call this function shortly after creating a new
        thread, passing it a [struct`GLib`.MainContext] which will be run by a
        [struct`GLib`.MainLoop] in that thread, to set a new default context for all
        async operations in that thread. In this case you may not need to
        ever call [method`GLib`.MainContext.pop_thread_default], assuming you want
        the new [struct`GLib`.MainContext] to be the default for the whole lifecycle
        of the thread.

        If you don't have control over how the new thread was created (e.g.
        in the new thread isn't newly created, or if the thread life
        cycle is managed by a GThreadPool), it is always suggested to wrap
        the logic that needs to use the new [struct`GLib`.MainContext] inside a
        [method`GLib`.MainContext.push_thread_default] /
        [method`GLib`.MainContext.pop_thread_default] pair, otherwise threads that
        are re-used will end up never explicitly releasing the
        [struct`GLib`.MainContext] reference they hold.

        In some cases you may want to schedule a single operation in a
        non-default context, or temporarily use a non-default context in
        the main thread. In that case, you can wrap the call to the
        asynchronous operation inside a
        [method`GLib`.MainContext.push_thread_default] /
        [method`GLib`.MainContext.pop_thread_default] pair, but it is up to you to
        ensure that no other asynchronous operations accidentally get
        started while the non-default context is active.

        Beware that libraries that predate this function may not correctly
        handle being used from a thread with a thread-default context. Eg,
        see `g_file_supports_thread_contexts`.

class RWLock(GObject.GPointer):
    """
    The GRWLock struct is an opaque data structure to represent a
    reader-writer lock. It is similar to a GMutex in that it allows
    multiple threads to coordinate access to a shared resource.

    The difference to a mutex is that a reader-writer lock discriminates
    between read-only ('reader') and full ('writer') access. While only
    one thread at a time is allowed write access (by holding the 'writer'
    lock via `g_rw_lock_writer_lock`), multiple threads can gain
    simultaneous read-only access (by holding the 'reader' lock via
    `g_rw_lock_reader_lock`).

    It is unspecified whether readers or writers have priority in acquiring the
    lock when a reader already holds the lock and a writer is queued to acquire
    it.

    Here is an example for an array with access functions:
    |[<!-- language="C" -->
      GRWLock lock;
      GPtrArray *array;

      gpointer
      my_array_get (guint index)
      {
        gpointer retval = None;

        if (!array)
          return None;

        g_rw_lock_reader_lock (&lock);
        if (index < array->len)
          retval = g_ptr_array_index (array, index);
        g_rw_lock_reader_unlock (&lock);

        return retval;
      }

      void
      my_array_set (guint index, gpointer data)
      {
        g_rw_lock_writer_lock (&lock);

        if (!array)
          array = g_ptr_array_new ();

        if (index >= array->len)
          g_ptr_array_set_size (array, index+1);
        g_ptr_array_index (array, index) = data;

        g_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&lock);
      }
     ]|
    This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
    (the `my_array_get` function) simultaneously, whereas the writers
    (the `my_array_set` function) will only be allowed one at a time
    and only if no readers currently access the array. This is because
    of the potentially dangerous resizing of the array. Using these
    functions is fully multi-thread safe now.

    If a GRWLock is allocated in static storage then it can be used
    without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call
    `g_rw_lock_init` on it and `g_rw_lock_clear` when done.

    The `GThreadPool` struct represents a thread pool.

    A thread pool is useful when you wish to asynchronously fork out the execution of work
    and continue working in your own thread. If that will happen often, the overhead of starting
    and destroying a thread each time might be too high. In such cases reusing already started
    threads seems like a good idea. And it indeed is, but implementing this can be tedious
    and error-prone.

    Therefore GLib provides thread pools for your convenience. An added advantage is, that the
    threads can be shared between the different subsystems of your program, when they are using GLib.

    To create a new thread pool, you use [func`GLib`.ThreadPool.new].
    It is destroyed by [method`GLib`.ThreadPool.free].

    If you want to execute a certain task within a thread pool, use [method`GLib`.ThreadPool.push].

    To get the current number of running threads you call [method`GLib`.ThreadPool.get_num_threads].
    To get the number of still unprocessed tasks you call [method`GLib`.ThreadPool.unprocessed].
    To control the maximum number of threads for a thread pool, you use
    [method`GLib`.ThreadPool.get_max_threads]. and [method`GLib`.ThreadPool.set_max_threads].

    Finally you can control the number of unused threads, that are kept alive by GLib for future use.
    The current number can be fetched with [func`GLib`.ThreadPool.get_num_unused_threads].
    The maximum number can be controlled by [func`GLib`.ThreadPool.get_max_unused_threads] and
    [func`GLib`.ThreadPool.set_max_unused_threads]. All currently unused threads
    can be stopped by calling [func`GLib`.ThreadPool.stop_unused_threads].

        """

class Variant(GObject.GPointer):
    """
    `GVariant` is a variant datatype; it can contain one or more values
    along with information about the type of the values.

    A `GVariant` may contain simple types, like an integer, or a boolean value;
    or complex types, like an array of two strings, or a dictionary of key
    value pairs. A `GVariant` is also immutable: once it’s been created neither
    its type nor its content can be modified further.

    `GVariant` is useful whenever data needs to be serialized, for example when
    sending method parameters in D-Bus, or when saving settings using
    [`GSettings`](../gio/class.Settings.html).

    When creating a new `GVariant`, you pass the data you want to store in it
    along with a string representing the type of data you wish to pass to it.

    For instance, if you want to create a `GVariant` holding an integer value you
    can use:

    ```c
    GVariant *v = g_variant_new ("u", 40);
    ```

    The string `u` in the first argument tells `GVariant` that the data passed to
    the constructor (`40`) is going to be an unsigned integer.

    More advanced examples of `GVariant` in use can be found in documentation for
    [`GVariant` format strings](gvariant-format-strings.html#pointers).

    The range of possible values is determined by the type.

    The type system used by `GVariant` is [type`GLib`.VariantType].

    `GVariant` instances always have a type and a value (which are given
    at construction time).  The type and value of a `GVariant` instance
    can never change other than by the `GVariant` itself being
    destroyed.  A `GVariant` cannot contain a pointer.

    `GVariant` is reference counted using [method`GLib`.Variant.ref] and
    [method`GLib`.Variant.unref].  `GVariant` also has floating reference counts —
    see [method`GLib`.Variant.ref_sink].

    `GVariant` is completely threadsafe.  A `GVariant` instance can be
    concurrently accessed in any way from any number of threads without
    problems.

    `GVariant` is heavily optimised for dealing with data in serialized
    form.  It works particularly well with data located in memory-mapped
    files.  It can perform nearly all deserialization operations in a
    small constant time, usually touching only a single memory page.
    Serialized `GVariant` data can also be sent over the network.

    `GVariant` is largely compatible with D-Bus.  Almost all types of
    `GVariant` instances can be sent over D-Bus.  See [type`GLib`.VariantType] for
    exceptions.  (However, `GVariant`’s serialization format is not the same
    as the serialization format of a D-Bus message body: use
    [GDBusMessage](../gio/class.DBusMessage.html), in the GIO library, for those.)

    For space-efficiency, the `GVariant` serialization format does not
    automatically include the variant’s length, type or endianness,
    which must either be implied from context (such as knowledge that a
    particular file format always contains a little-endian
    `G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT` which occupies the whole length of the file)
    or supplied out-of-band (for instance, a length, type and/or endianness
    indicator could be placed at the beginning of a file, network message
    or network stream).

    A `GVariant`’s size is limited mainly by any lower level operating
    system constraints, such as the number of bits in `gsize`.  For
    example, it is reasonable to have a 2GB file mapped into memory
    with [struct`GLib`.MappedFile], and call [ctor`GLib`.Variant.new_from_data] on
    it.

    For convenience to C programmers, `GVariant` features powerful
    varargs-based value construction and destruction.  This feature is
    designed to be embedded in other libraries.

    There is a Python-inspired text language for describing `GVariant`
    values.  `GVariant` includes a printer for this language and a parser
    with type inferencing.

    ## Memory Use

    `GVariant` tries to be quite efficient with respect to memory use.
    This section gives a rough idea of how much memory is used by the
    current implementation.  The information here is subject to change
    in the future.

    The memory allocated by `GVariant` can be grouped into 4 broad
    purposes: memory for serialized data, memory for the type
    information cache, buffer management memory and memory for the
    `GVariant` structure itself.

    ## Serialized Data Memory

    This is the memory that is used for storing `GVariant` data in
    serialized form.  This is what would be sent over the network or
    what would end up on disk, not counting any indicator of the
    endianness, or of the length or type of the top-level variant.

    The amount of memory required to store a boolean is 1 byte. 16,
    32 and 64 bit integers and double precision floating point numbers
    use their ‘natural’ size.  Strings (including object path and
    signature strings) are stored with a nul terminator, and as such
    use the length of the string plus 1 byte.

    ‘Maybe’ types use no space at all to represent the null value and
    use the same amount of space (sometimes plus one byte) as the
    equivalent non-maybe-typed value to represent the non-null case.

    Arrays use the amount of space required to store each of their
    members, concatenated.  Additionally, if the items stored in an
    array are not of a fixed-size (ie: strings, other arrays, etc)
    then an additional framing offset is stored for each item.  The
    size of this offset is either 1, 2 or 4 bytes depending on the
    overall size of the container.  Additionally, extra padding bytes
    are added as required for alignment of child values.

    Tuples (including dictionary entries) use the amount of space
    required to store each of their members, concatenated, plus one
    framing offset (as per arrays) for each non-fixed-sized item in
    the tuple, except for the last one.  Additionally, extra padding
    bytes are added as required for alignment of child values.

    Variants use the same amount of space as the item inside of the
    variant, plus 1 byte, plus the length of the type string for the
    item inside the variant.

    As an example, consider a dictionary mapping strings to variants.
    In the case that the dictionary is empty, 0 bytes are required for
    the serialization.

    If we add an item ‘width’ that maps to the int32 value of 500 then
    we will use 4 bytes to store the int32 (so 6 for the variant
    containing it) and 6 bytes for the string.  The variant must be
    aligned to 8 after the 6 bytes of the string, so that’s 2 extra
    bytes.  6 (string) + 2 (padding) + 6 (variant) is 14 bytes used
    for the dictionary entry.  An additional 1 byte is added to the
    array as a framing offset making a total of 15 bytes.

    If we add another entry, ‘title’ that maps to a nullable string
    that happens to have a value of null, then we use 0 bytes for the
    null value (and 3 bytes for the variant to contain it along with
    its type string) plus 6 bytes for the string.  Again, we need 2
    padding bytes.  That makes a total of 6 + 2 + 3 = 11 bytes.

    We now require extra padding between the two items in the array.
    After the 14 bytes of the first item, that’s 2 bytes required.
    We now require 2 framing offsets for an extra two
    bytes. 14 + 2 + 11 + 2 = 29 bytes to encode the entire two-item
    dictionary.

    ## Type Information Cache

    For each `GVariant` type that currently exists in the program a type
    information structure is kept in the type information cache.  The
    type information structure is required for rapid deserialization.

    Continuing with the above example, if a `GVariant` exists with the
    type `a{sv}` then a type information struct will exist for
    `a{sv}`, `{sv}`, `s`, and `v`.  Multiple uses of the same type
    will share the same type information.  Additionally, all
    single-digit types are stored in read-only static memory and do
    not contribute to the writable memory footprint of a program using
    `GVariant`.

    Aside from the type information structures stored in read-only
    memory, there are two forms of type information.  One is used for
    container types where there is a single element type: arrays and
    maybe types.  The other is used for container types where there
    are multiple element types: tuples and dictionary entries.

    Array type info structures are `6 * sizeof (void *)`, plus the
    memory required to store the type string itself.  This means that
    on 32-bit systems, the cache entry for `a{sv}` would require 30
    bytes of memory (plus allocation overhead).

    Tuple type info structures are `6 * sizeof (void *)`, plus `4 *
    sizeof (void *)` for each item in the tuple, plus the memory
    required to store the type string itself.  A 2-item tuple, for
    example, would have a type information structure that consumed
    writable memory in the size of `14 * sizeof (void *)` (plus type
    string)  This means that on 32-bit systems, the cache entry for
    `{sv}` would require 61 bytes of memory (plus allocation overhead).

    This means that in total, for our `a{sv}` example, 91 bytes of
    type information would be allocated.

    The type information cache, additionally, uses a [struct`GLib`.HashTable] to
    store and look up the cached items and stores a pointer to this
    hash table in static storage.  The hash table is freed when there
    are zero items in the type cache.

    Although these sizes may seem large it is important to remember
    that a program will probably only have a very small number of
    different types of values in it and that only one type information
    structure is required for many different values of the same type.

    ## Buffer Management Memory

    `GVariant` uses an internal buffer management structure to deal
    with the various different possible sources of serialized data
    that it uses.  The buffer is responsible for ensuring that the
    correct call is made when the data is no longer in use by
    `GVariant`.  This may involve a [func`GLib`.free] or
    even [method`GLib`.MappedFile.unref].

    One buffer management structure is used for each chunk of
    serialized data.  The size of the buffer management structure
    is `4 * (void *)`.  On 32-bit systems, that’s 16 bytes.

    ## GVariant structure

    The size of a `GVariant` structure is `6 * (void *)`.  On 32-bit
    systems, that’s 24 bytes.

    `GVariant` structures only exist if they are explicitly created
    with API calls.  For example, if a `GVariant` is constructed out of
    serialized data for the example given above (with the dictionary)
    then although there are 9 individual values that comprise the
    entire dictionary (two keys, two values, two variants containing
    the values, two dictionary entries, plus the dictionary itself),
    only 1 `GVariant` instance exists — the one referring to the
    dictionary.

    If calls are made to start accessing the other values then
    `GVariant` instances will exist for those values only for as long
    as they are in use (ie: until you call [method`GLib`.Variant.unref]).  The
    type information is shared.  The serialized data and the buffer
    management structure for that serialized data is shared by the
    child.

    ## Summary

    To put the entire example together, for our dictionary mapping
    strings to variants (with two entries, as given above), we are
    using 91 bytes of memory for type information, 29 bytes of memory
    for the serialized data, 16 bytes for buffer management and 24
    bytes for the `GVariant` instance, or a total of 160 bytes, plus
    allocation overhead.  If we were to use [method`GLib`.Variant.get_child_value]
    to access the two dictionary entries, we would use an additional 48
    bytes.  If we were to have other dictionaries of the same type, we
    would use more memory for the serialized data and buffer
    management for those dictionaries, but the type information would
    be shared.

        While this function can safely handle untrusted, non-normal data, it is

        Typically you want to use `g_variant_ref_sink` in order to
        automatically do the correct thing with respect to floating or
        non-floating references, but there is one specific scenario where
        this function is helpful.

        The situation where this function is helpful is when creating an API
        that allows the user to provide a callback function that returns a
        GVariant.  We certainly want to allow the user the flexibility to
        return a non-floating reference from this callback (for the case
        where the value that is being returned already exists).

        At the same time, the style of the GVariant API makes it likely that
        for newly-created GVariant instances, the user can be saved some
        typing if they are allowed to return a GVariant with a floating
        reference.

        Using this function on the return value of the user's callback allows
        the user to do whichever is more convenient for them.  The caller
        will always receives exactly one full reference to the value: either
        the one that was returned in the first place, or a floating reference
        that has been converted to a full reference.

        This function has an odd interaction when combined with
        `g_variant_ref_sink` running at the same time in another thread on
        the same GVariant instance.  If `g_variant_ref_sink` runs first then

    GVariantDict is a mutable interface to GVariant dictionaries.

    It can be used for doing a sequence of dictionary lookups in an
    efficient way on an existing GVariant dictionary or it can be used
    to construct new dictionaries with a hashtable-like interface.  It
    can also be used for taking existing dictionaries and modifying them
    in order to create new ones.

    GVariantDict can only be used with G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARDICT
    dictionaries.

    It is possible to use GVariantDict allocated on the stack or on the
    heap.  When using a stack-allocated GVariantDict, you begin with a
    call to `g_variant_dict_init` and free the resources with a call to
    `g_variant_dict_clear`.

    Heap-allocated GVariantDict follows normal refcounting rules: you
    allocate it with `g_variant_dict_new` and use `g_variant_dict_ref`
    and `g_variant_dict_unref`.

    `g_variant_dict_end` is used to convert the GVariantDict back into a
    dictionary-type GVariant.  When used with stack-allocated instances,
    this also implicitly frees all associated memory, but for
    heap-allocated instances, you must still call `g_variant_dict_unref`
    afterwards.

    You will typically want to use a heap-allocated GVariantDict when
    you expose it as part of an API.  For most other uses, the
    stack-allocated form will be more convenient.

    Consider the following two examples that do the same thing in each
    style: take an existing dictionary and look up the "count" uint32
    key, adding 1 to it if it is found, or returning an error if the
    key is not found.  Each returns the new dictionary as a floating
    GVariant.

    A type in the [type`GLib`.Variant] type system.

    valid, and they are typically expected to be static (i.e. not provided by
    user input) as they determine how binary [type`GLib`.Variant] data is
    interpreted.

    To convert a static string to a [type`GLib`.VariantType] in C, use the

    enabled, it will validate the type. To check if an arbitrary string is a
    valid [type`GLib`.VariantType], use [func`GLib`.VariantType.string_is_valid].

    ## GVariant Type System

    This section introduces the [type`GLib`.Variant] type system. It is based, in
    large part, on the D-Bus type system, with two major changes and
    some minor lifting of restrictions. The
    [D-Bus specification](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html),
    therefore, provides a significant amount of
    information that is useful when working with [type`GLib`.Variant].

    The first major change with respect to the D-Bus type system is the
    introduction of maybe (or ‘nullable’) types.  Any type in [type`GLib`.Variant]
    can be converted to a maybe type, in which case, `nothing` (or `null`)
    becomes a valid value.  Maybe types have been added by introducing the
    character `m` to type strings.

    The second major change is that the [type`GLib`.Variant] type system supports
    the concept of ‘indefinite types’ — types that are less specific than
    the normal types found in D-Bus.  For example, it is possible to speak
    of ‘an array of any type’ in [type`GLib`.Variant], where the D-Bus type system
    would require you to speak of ‘an array of integers’ or ‘an array of
    strings’.  Indefinite types have been added by introducing the
    characters `*`, `?` and `r` to type strings.

    Finally, all arbitrary restrictions relating to the complexity of
    types are lifted along with the restriction that dictionary entries
    may only appear nested inside of arrays.

    Just as in D-Bus, [type`GLib`.Variant] types are described with strings (‘type
    strings’).  Subject to the differences mentioned above, these strings
    are of the same form as those found in D-Bus.  Note, however: D-Bus
    always works in terms of messages and therefore individual type
    strings appear nowhere in its interface.  Instead, ‘signatures’
    are a concatenation of the strings of the type of each argument in a
    message.  [type`GLib`.Variant] deals with single values directly so
    [type`GLib`.Variant] type strings always describe the type of exactly one
    value.  This means that a D-Bus signature string is generally not a valid
    [type`GLib`.Variant] type string — except in the case that it is the signature
    of a message containing exactly one argument.

    An indefinite type is similar in spirit to what may be called an
    abstract type in other type systems.  No value can exist that has an
    indefinite type as its type, but values can exist that have types
    that are subtypes of indefinite types.  That is to say,
    [method`GLib`.Variant.get_type] will never return an indefinite type, but
    calling [method`GLib`.Variant.is_of_type] with an indefinite type may return
    true.  For example, you cannot have a value that represents ‘an
    array of no particular type’, but you can have an ‘array of integers’
    which certainly matches the type of ‘an array of no particular type’,
    since ‘array of integers’ is a subtype of ‘array of no particular
    type’.

    This is similar to how instances of abstract classes may not
    directly exist in other type systems, but instances of their
    non-abstract subtypes may.  For example, in GTK, no object that has
    the type of [`GtkWidget`](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Widget.html) can
    exist (since `GtkWidget` is an abstract class), but a [`GtkWindow`](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Window.html)
    can certainly be instantiated, and you would say that a `GtkWindow` is a
    `GtkWidget` (since `GtkWindow` is a subclass of `GtkWidget`).

    Two types may not be compared by value; use [method`GLib`.VariantType.equal]
    or [method`GLib`.VariantType.is_subtype_of]  May be copied using
    [method`GLib`.VariantType.copy] and freed using [method`GLib`.VariantType.free].

    ## GVariant Type Strings

    A [type`GLib`.Variant] type string can be any of the following:

    - any basic type string (listed below)
    - `v`, `r` or `*`
    - one of the characters `a` or `m`, followed by another type string
    - the character `(`, followed by a concatenation of zero or more other
      type strings, followed by the character `)`
    - the character `{`, followed by a basic type string (see below),
      followed by another type string, followed by the character `}`

    A basic type string describes a basic type (as per
    [method`GLib`.VariantType.is_basic]) and is always a single character in
    length. The valid basic type strings are `b`, `y`, `n`, `q`, `i`, `u`, `x`,
    `t`, `h`, `d`, `s`, `o`, `g` and `?`.

    The above definition is recursive to arbitrary depth. `aaaaai` and
    `(ui(nq((y)))s)` are both valid type strings, as is
    `a(aa(ui)(qna{ya(yd)}))`. In order to not hit memory limits,
    [type`GLib`.Variant] imposes a limit on recursion depth of 65 nested
    containers. This is the limit in the D-Bus specification (64) plus one to
    allow a [`GDBusMessage`](../gio/class.DBusMessage.html) to be nested in
    a top-level tuple.

    The meaning of each of the characters is as follows:

    - `b`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_BOOLEAN`; a boolean value.
    - `y`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_BYTE`; a byte.
    - `n`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT16`; a signed 16 bit integer.
    - `q`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT16`; an unsigned 16 bit integer.
    - `i`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT32`; a signed 32 bit integer.
    - `u`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT32`; an unsigned 32 bit integer.
    - `x`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT64`; a signed 64 bit integer.
    - `t`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT64`; an unsigned 64 bit integer.
    - `h`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_HANDLE`; a signed 32 bit value
      that, by convention, is used as an index into an array of file
      descriptors that are sent alongside a D-Bus message.
    - `d`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE`; a double precision
      floating point value.
    - `s`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING`; a string.
    - `o`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_OBJECT_PATH`; a string in the form
      of a D-Bus object path.
    - `g`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_SIGNATURE`; a string in the form of
      a D-Bus type signature.
    - `?`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_BASIC`; an indefinite type that
      is a supertype of any of the basic types.
    - `v`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT`; a container type that
      contain any other type of value.
    - `a`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean an array of that
      type; the type string `ai`, for example, is the type of an array of
      signed 32-bit integers.
    - `m`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean a ‘maybe’, or
      ‘nullable’, version of that type; the type string `ms`, for example,
      is the type of a value that maybe contains a string, or maybe contains
      nothing.
    - `()`: used to enclose zero or more other concatenated type strings to
      create a tuple type; the type string `(is)`, for example, is the type of
      a pair of an integer and a string.
    - `r`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_TUPLE`; an indefinite type that is
      a supertype of any tuple type, regardless of the number of items.
    - `{}`: used to enclose a basic type string concatenated with another type
      string to create a dictionary entry type, which usually appears inside of
      an array to form a dictionary; the type string `a{sd}`, for example, is
      the type of a dictionary that maps strings to double precision floating
      point values.

      The first type (the basic type) is the key type and the second type is
      the value type. The reason that the first type is restricted to being a
      basic type is so that it can easily be hashed.
    - `*`: the type string of `G_VARIANT_TYPE_ANY`; the indefinite type that is
      a supertype of all types.  Note that, as with all type strings, this
      character represents exactly one type. It cannot be used inside of tuples
      to mean ‘any number of items’.

    Any type string of a container that contains an indefinite type is,
    itself, an indefinite type. For example, the type string `a*`
    (corresponding to `G_VARIANT_TYPE_ARRAY`) is an indefinite type
    that is a supertype of every array type. `(*s)` is a supertype
    of all tuples that contain exactly two items where the second
    item is a string.

    `a{?*}` is an indefinite type that is a supertype of all arrays
