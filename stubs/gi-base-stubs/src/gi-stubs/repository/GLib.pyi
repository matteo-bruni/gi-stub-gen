    A wrapper for the POSIX access() function. This function is used to

) -> None:
    """
    Specifies a function to be called at normal program termination.

    Since GLib 2.8.2, on Windows g_atexit() actually is a preprocessor
    macro that maps to a call to the atexit() function in the C
    library. This means that in case the code that calls g_atexit(),
    i.e. atexit(), is in a DLL, the function will be called when the
    DLL is detached from the program. This typically makes more sense
    than that the function is called when the GLib DLL is detached,
    which happened earlier when g_atexit() was a function in the GLib
    DLL.

    The behaviour of atexit() in the context of dynamically loaded
    modules is not formally specified and varies wildly.

    On POSIX systems, calling g_atexit() (or atexit()) in a dynamically
    loaded module which is unloaded before the program terminates might
    well cause a crash at program exit.

    Some POSIX systems implement atexit() like Windows, and have each
    dynamically loaded module maintain an own atexit chain that is
    called when the module is unloaded.

    On other POSIX systems, before a dynamically loaded module is
    unloaded, the registered atexit functions (if any) residing in that
    module are called, regardless where the code that registered them
    resided. This is presumably the most robust approach.

    As can be seen from the above, for portability it's best to avoid
    calling g_atexit() (or atexit()) except in the main executable of a
    program.

    Note that child watch sources can only be used in conjunction with
    `g_spawn...` when the %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag is used.

    Note that on platforms where #GPid must be explicitly closed
    (see [func@GLib.spawn_close_pid]) @pid must not be closed while the
    source is still active. Typically, you will want to call
    [func@GLib.spawn_close_pid] in the callback function for the source.

    On POSIX platforms, the following restrictions apply to this API
    due to limitations in POSIX process interfaces:

    * @pid must be a child of this process
    * @pid must be positive
    * the application must not call `waitpid` with a non-positive
      first argument, for instance in another thread
    * the application must not wait for @pid to exit by any other
      mechanism, including `waitpid(pid, ...)` or a second child-watch
      source for the same @pid
    * the application must not ignore `SIGCHLD`
    * Before 2.78, the application could not send a signal (`kill()`) to the
      watched @pid in a race free manner. Since 2.78, you can do that while the
      associated [struct@GLib.MainContext] is acquired.
    * Before 2.78, even after destroying the [struct@GLib.Source], you could not
      be sure that @pid wasn't already reaped. Hence, it was also not
      safe to `kill()` or `waitpid()` on the process ID after the child watch
      source was gone. Destroying the source before it fired made it
      impossible to reliably reap the process.

    If any of those conditions are not met, this and related APIs will
    not work correctly. This can often be diagnosed via a GLib warning
    stating that `ECHILD` was received by `waitpid`.

    Calling `waitpid` for specific processes other than @pid remains a
    valid thing to do.

    Writes all of @contents to a file named @filename, with good error checking.
    If a file called @filename already exists it will be overwritten.

    @flags control the properties of the write operation: whether it’s atomic,
    and what the tradeoff is between returning quickly or being resilient to
    system crashes.

    As this function performs file I/O, it is recommended to not call it anywhere
    where blocking would cause problems, such as in the main loop of a graphical
    application. In particular, if @flags has any value other than
    %G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_NONE then this function may call `fsync()`.

    If %G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT is set in @flags, the operation is atomic
    in the sense that it is first written to a temporary file which is then
    renamed to the final name.

    Notes:

    - On UNIX, if @filename already exists hard links to @filename will break.
      Also since the file is recreated, existing permissions, access control
      lists, metadata etc. may be lost. If @filename is a symbolic link,
      the link itself will be replaced, not the linked file.

    - On UNIX, if @filename already exists and is non-empty, and if the system
      supports it (via a journalling filesystem or equivalent), and if
      %G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT is set in @flags, the `fsync()` call (or
      equivalent) will be used to ensure atomic replacement: @filename
      will contain either its old contents or @contents, even in the face of
      system power loss, the disk being unsafely removed, etc.

    - On UNIX, if @filename does not already exist or is empty, there is a
      possibility that system power loss etc. after calling this function will
      leave @filename empty or full of NUL bytes, depending on the underlying
      filesystem, unless %G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_DURABLE and
      %G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT are set in @flags.

    - On Windows renaming a file will not remove an existing file with the
      new name, so on Windows there is a race condition between the existing
      file being removed and the temporary file being renamed.

    - On Windows there is no way to remove a file that is open to some
      process, or mapped into memory. Thus, this function will fail if
      @filename already exists and is open.

    If the call was successful, it returns %TRUE. If the call was not successful,
    it returns %FALSE and sets @error. The error domain is %G_FILE_ERROR.
    Possible error codes are those in the #GFileError enumeration.

    Note that the name for the temporary file is constructed by appending up
    to 7 characters to @filename.

    If the file didn’t exist before and is created, it will be given the
    permissions from @mode. Otherwise, the permissions of the existing file may
    be changed to @mode depending on @flags, or they may remain unchanged.

    directory doesn't matter since the existence test is %TRUE. With
    the current set of available tests, there's no point passing in
    more than one test at a time.

    Apart from %G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK all tests follow symbolic links,
    so for a symbolic link to a regular file g_file_test() will return
    %TRUE for both %G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK and %G_FILE_TEST_IS_REGULAR.

    Note, that for a dangling symbolic link g_file_test() will return
    %TRUE for %G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK and %FALSE for all other flags.

    You should never use g_file_test() to test whether it is safe

    of the condition changing before you actually perform the operation,
    see [TOCTOU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use).

    For example, you might think you could use %G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK

    Another thing to note is that %G_FILE_TEST_EXISTS and
    %G_FILE_TEST_IS_EXECUTABLE are implemented using the access()
    system call. This usually doesn't matter, but if your program
    is setuid or setgid it means that these tests will give you
    the answer for the real user ID and group ID, rather than the
    effective user ID and group ID.

    On Windows, there are no symlinks, so testing for
    %G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK will always return %FALSE. Testing for
    %G_FILE_TEST_IS_EXECUTABLE will just check that the file exists and
    its name indicates that it is executable, checking for well-known

    This works from an application, however, if you want to do the same

    function to make the call to free_allocated_memory(), but that
    doesn't work, since the idle function could be called from a

    There is a temptation to use [func@GLib.main_depth] to solve
    problems with reentrancy. For instance, while waiting for data
    to be received from the network in response to a menu item,
    the menu item might be selected again. It might seem that
    one could make the menu item's callback return immediately
    and do nothing if [func@GLib.main_depth] returns a value greater than 1.
    However, this should be avoided since the user then sees selecting
    the menu item do nothing. Furthermore, you'll find yourself adding
    these checks all over your code, since there are doubtless many,
    many things that the user could do. Instead, you can use the
    following techniques:

    1. Use gtk_widget_set_sensitive() or modal dialogs to prevent
       the user from interacting with elements while the main
       loop is recursing.

    2. Avoid main loop recursion in situations where you can't handle
       arbitrary  callbacks. Instead, structure your code so that you
       simply return to the main loop and then get called again when
       there is more work to do.

    """
    Executes a child program asynchronously (your program will not
    block waiting for the child to exit).

    The child program is specified by the only argument that must be
    provided, @argv. @argv should be a %NULL-terminated array of strings,
    to be passed as the argument vector for the child. The first string
    in @argv is of course the name of the program to execute. By default,
    the name of the program must be a full path. If @flags contains the
    %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH flag, the `PATH` environment variable is used to
    search for the executable. If @flags contains the
    %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP flag, the `PATH` variable from @envp
    is used to search for the executable. If both the
    %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH and %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP flags are
    set, the `PATH` variable from @envp takes precedence over the
    environment variable.

    If the program name is not a full path and %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH flag
    is not used, then the program will be run from the current directory
    (or @working_directory, if specified); this might be unexpected or even
    dangerous in some cases when the current directory is world-writable.

    On Windows, note that all the string or string vector arguments to
    this function and the other `g_spawn*()` functions are in UTF-8, the
    GLib file name encoding. Unicode characters that are not part of
    the system codepage passed in these arguments will be correctly
    available in the spawned program only if it uses wide character API
    to retrieve its command line. For C programs built with Microsoft's
    tools it is enough to make the program have a `wmain()` instead of
    `main()`. `wmain()` has a wide character argument vector as parameter.

    At least currently, mingw doesn't support `wmain()`, so if you use
    mingw to develop the spawned program, it should call
    g_win32_get_command_line() to get arguments in UTF-8.

    On Windows the low-level child process creation API `CreateProcess()`
    doesn't use argument vectors, but a command line. The C runtime
    library's `spawn*()` family of functions (which g_spawn_async_with_pipes()
    eventually calls) paste the argument vector elements together into
    a command line, and the C runtime startup code does a corresponding
    reconstruction of an argument vector from the command line, to be
    passed to `main()`. Complications arise when you have argument vector
    elements that contain spaces or double quotes. The `spawn*()` functions
    don't do any quoting or escaping, but on the other hand the startup
    code does do unquoting and unescaping in order to enable receiving
    arguments with embedded spaces or double quotes. To work around this
    asymmetry, g_spawn_async_with_pipes() will do quoting and escaping on
    argument vector elements that need it before calling the C runtime
    `spawn()` function.

    The returned @child_pid on Windows is a handle to the child
    process, not its identifier. Process handles and process
    identifiers are different concepts on Windows.

    @envp is a %NULL-terminated array of strings, where each string
    has the form `KEY=VALUE`. This will become the child's environment.
    If @envp is %NULL, the child inherits its parent's environment.

    @flags should be the bitwise OR of any flags you want to affect the
    function's behaviour. The %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD means that the
    child will not automatically be reaped; you must use a child watch
    (g_child_watch_add()) to be notified about the death of the child process,
    otherwise it will stay around as a zombie process until this process exits.
    Eventually you must call g_spawn_close_pid() on the @child_pid, in order to
    free resources which may be associated with the child process. (On Unix,
    using a child watch is equivalent to calling waitpid() or handling
    the `SIGCHLD` signal manually. On Windows, calling g_spawn_close_pid()
    is equivalent to calling `CloseHandle()` on the process handle returned
    in @child_pid). See g_child_watch_add().

    Open UNIX file descriptors marked as `FD_CLOEXEC` will be automatically
    closed in the child process. %G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN means that
    other open file descriptors will be inherited by the child; otherwise all
    descriptors except stdin/stdout/stderr will be closed before calling `exec()`
    in the child. %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH means that @argv[0] need not be an
    absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` environment
    variable. %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP means need not be an
    absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` variable from
    @envp. If both %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH and %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP
    are used, the value from @envp takes precedence over the environment.

    %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN means that the child will inherit the parent's
    standard input (by default, the child's standard input is attached to
    `/dev/null`). %G_SPAWN_STDIN_FROM_DEV_NULL explicitly imposes the default
    behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in both cases,
    the @stdin_pipe_out argument is ignored.

    %G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL means that the child's standard output
    will be discarded (by default, it goes to the same location as the parent's
    standard output). %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDOUT explicitly imposes the
    default behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in
    both cases, the @stdout_pipe_out argument is ignored.

    %G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL means that the child's standard error
    will be discarded (by default, it goes to the same location as the parent's
    standard error). %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDERR explicitly imposes the
    default behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in
    both cases, the @stderr_pipe_out argument is ignored.

    It is valid to pass the same FD in multiple parameters (e.g. you can pass
    a single FD for both @stdout_fd and @stderr_fd, and include it in
    @source_fds too).

    @source_fds and @target_fds allow zero or more FDs from this process to be
    remapped to different FDs in the spawned process. If @n_fds is greater than
    zero, @source_fds and @target_fds must both be non-%NULL and the same length.
    Each FD in @source_fds is remapped to the FD number at the same index in
    @target_fds. The source and target FD may be equal to simply propagate an FD
    to the spawned process. FD remappings are processed after standard FDs, so
    any target FDs which equal @stdin_fd, @stdout_fd or @stderr_fd will overwrite
    them in the spawned process.

    @source_fds is supported on Windows since 2.72.

    %G_SPAWN_FILE_AND_ARGV_ZERO means that the first element of @argv is
    the file to execute, while the remaining elements are the actual
    argument vector to pass to the file. Normally g_spawn_async_with_pipes()
    uses @argv[0] as the file to execute, and passes all of @argv to the child.

    @child_setup and @user_data are a function and user data. On POSIX
    platforms, the function is called in the child after GLib has
    performed all the setup it plans to perform (including creating
    pipes, closing file descriptors, etc.) but before calling `exec()`.
    That is, @child_setup is called just before calling `exec()` in the
    child. Obviously actions taken in this function will only affect
    the child, not the parent.

    On Windows, there is no separate `fork()` and `exec()` functionality.
    Child processes are created and run with a single API call,
    `CreateProcess()`. There is no sensible thing @child_setup
    could be used for on Windows so it is ignored and not called.

    If non-%NULL, @child_pid will on Unix be filled with the child's
    process ID. You can use the process ID to send signals to the child,
    or to use g_child_watch_add() (or `waitpid()`) if you specified the
    %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag. On Windows, @child_pid will be
    filled with a handle to the child process only if you specified the
    %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag. You can then access the child
    process using the Win32 API, for example wait for its termination
    with the `WaitFor*()` functions, or examine its exit code with
    `GetExitCodeProcess()`. You should close the handle with `CloseHandle()`
    or g_spawn_close_pid() when you no longer need it.

    If non-%NULL, the @stdin_pipe_out, @stdout_pipe_out, @stderr_pipe_out
    locations will be filled with file descriptors for writing to the child's
    standard input or reading from its standard output or standard error.
    The caller of g_spawn_async_with_pipes() must close these file descriptors
    when they are no longer in use. If these parameters are %NULL, the
    corresponding pipe won't be created.

    If @stdin_pipe_out is %NULL, the child's standard input is attached to
    `/dev/null` unless %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN is set.

    If @stderr_pipe_out is NULL, the child's standard error goes to the same
    location as the parent's standard error unless %G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL
    is set.

    If @stdout_pipe_out is NULL, the child's standard output goes to the same
    location as the parent's standard output unless %G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL
    is set.

    @error can be %NULL to ignore errors, or non-%NULL to report errors.
    If an error is set, the function returns %FALSE. Errors are reported
    even if they occur in the child (for example if the executable in
    `@argv[0]` is not found). Typically the `message` field of returned
    errors should be displayed to users. Possible errors are those from
    the %G_SPAWN_ERROR domain.

    If an error occurs, @child_pid, @stdin_pipe_out, @stdout_pipe_out,
    and @stderr_pipe_out will not be filled with valid values.

    If @child_pid is not %NULL and an error does not occur then the returned
    process reference must be closed using g_spawn_close_pid().

    On modern UNIX platforms, GLib can use an efficient process launching
    codepath driven internally by `posix_spawn()`. This has the advantage of
    avoiding the fork-time performance costs of cloning the parent process
    address space, and avoiding associated memory overcommit checks that are
    not relevant in the context of immediately executing a distinct process.
    This optimized codepath will be used provided that the following conditions
    are met:

    1. %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD is set
    2. %G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN is set
    3. %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP is not set
    4. @working_directory is %NULL
    5. @child_setup is %NULL
    6. The program is of a recognised binary format, or has a shebang.
       Otherwise, GLib will have to execute the program through the
       shell, which is not done using the optimized codepath.

    If you are writing a GTK application, and the program you are spawning is a
    graphical application too, then to ensure that the spawned program opens its
    windows on the right screen, you may want to use #GdkAppLaunchContext,
    #GAppLaunchContext, or set the `DISPLAY` environment variable.

    status of subprocesses encoded in a platform-specific way.
    On Unix, this is guaranteed to be in the same format waitpid() returns,
    and on Windows it is guaranteed to be the result of GetExitCodeProcess().

    Prior to the introduction of this function in GLib 2.34, interpreting
    @wait_status required use of platform-specific APIs, which is problematic
    for software using GLib as a cross-platform layer.

    Additionally, many programs simply want to determine whether or not
    the child exited successfully, and either propagate a #GError or
    print a message to standard error. In that common case, this function
    can be used. Note that the error message in @error will contain
    human-readable information about the wait status.

    The @domain and @code of @error have special semantics in the case
    where the process has an "exit code", as opposed to being killed by
    a signal. On Unix, this happens if WIFEXITED() would be true of
    @wait_status. On Windows, it is always the case.

    The special semantics are that the actual exit code will be the
    code set in @error, and the domain will be %G_SPAWN_EXIT_ERROR.
    This allows you to differentiate between different exit codes.

    If the process was terminated by some means other than an exit
    status (for example if it was killed by a signal), the domain will be
    %G_SPAWN_ERROR and the code will be %G_SPAWN_ERROR_FAILED.

    This function just offers convenience; you can of course also check
    the available platform via a macro such as %G_OS_UNIX, and use
    WIFEXITED() and WEXITSTATUS() on @wait_status directly. Do not attempt
    to scan or parse the error message string; it may be translated and/or
    change in future versions of GLib.

    Prior to version 2.70, g_spawn_check_exit_status() provides the same
    functionality, although under a misleading name.
