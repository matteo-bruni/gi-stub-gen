      hb_buffer_add_latin1() expect that buffer is either empty and
      have a content type of invalid, or that buffer content type is
      %HB_BUFFER_CONTENT_TYPE_UNICODE, and they also set the content
      type to Unicode if they added anything to an empty buffer.

    - Finally hb_shape() and hb_shape_full() expect that the buffer
      is either empty and have content type of invalid, or that buffer
      content type is %HB_BUFFER_CONTENT_TYPE_UNICODE, and upon
      success they set the buffer content type to

    The above transitions are designed such that one can use a buffer

    modify the content type manually.

    Sets the horizontal and vertical scale of a font.

    The font scale is a number related to, but not the same as,

    to be used between the two. For example, 64, or 256, which
    would be the fractional-precision part of the font scale.
    This is necessary because #hb_position_t values are integer
    types and you need to leave room for fractional values
    in there.

    For example, to set the font size to 20, with 64
    levels of fractional precision you would call
    `hb_font_set_scale(font, 20 * 64, 20 * 64)`.

    In the example above, even what font size 20 means is up to
    you. It might be 20 pixels, or 20 points, or 20 millimeters.
    HarfBuzz does not care about that.  You can set the point
    size of the font using hb_font_set_ptem(), and the pixel
    size using hb_font_set_ppem().

    what you set here, and what you expect out of #hb_position_t

    				   #HB_GLYPH_FLAG_UNSAFE_TO_BREAK or when
    				   hyphenation or other text transformation
    				   happens at line-break position, in the following
    				   way:
    				   1. Iterate back from the line-break position
    				   until the first cluster start position that is
    				   NOT unsafe-to-concat, 2. shape the segment from
    				   there till the end of line, 3. check whether the
    				   resulting glyph-run also is clear of the
    				   unsafe-to-concat at its start-of-text position;
    				   if it is, just splice it into place and the line
    				   is shaped; If not, move on to a position further
    				   back that is clear of unsafe-to-concat and retry
    				   from there, and repeat.
    				   At the start of next line a similar algorithm can
    				   be implemented. That is: 1. Iterate forward from
    				   the line-break position until the first cluster
    				   start position that is NOT unsafe-to-concat, 2.
    				   shape the segment from beginning of the line to
    				   that position, 3. check whether the resulting
    				   glyph-run also is clear of the unsafe-to-concat
    				   at its end-of-text position; if it is, just splice
    				   it into place and the beginning is shaped; If not,
    				   move on to a position further forward that is clear
    				   of unsafe-to-concat and retry up to there, and repeat.
    				   A slight complication will arise in the
    				   implementation of the algorithm above,
    				   because while our buffer API has a way to
    				   return flags for position corresponding to
    				   start-of-text, there is currently no position
    				   corresponding to end-of-text.  This limitation
    				   can be alleviated by shaping more text than needed
    				   and looking for unsafe-to-concat flag within text
    				   clusters.
    				   The #HB_GLYPH_FLAG_UNSAFE_TO_BREAK flag will
    				   always imply this flag.
    			   To use this flag, you must enable the buffer flag
