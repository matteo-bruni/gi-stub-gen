    choose a default language for %PANGO_SCRIPT_HAN when setting

    """
    A `PangoLayout` structure represents an entire paragraph of text.

    While complete access to the layout capabilities of Pango is provided
    using the detailed interfaces for itemization and shaping, using
    that functionality directly involves writing a fairly large amount
    of code. `PangoLayout` provides a high-level driver for formatting
    entire paragraphs of text at once. This includes paragraph-level
    functionality such as line breaking, justification, alignment and
    ellipsization.

    A `PangoLayout` is initialized with a `PangoContext`, UTF-8 string
    and set of attributes for that string. Once that is done, the set of
    formatted lines can be extracted from the object, the layout can be
    rendered, and conversion between logical character positions within
    the layout's text, and the physical position of the resulting glyphs
    can be made.

    There are a number of parameters to adjust the formatting of a
    `PangoLayout`. The following image shows adjustable parameters
    (on the left) and font metrics (on the right):

    <picture>
      <source srcset="layout-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
      <img alt="Pango Layout Parameters" src="layout-light.png">
    </picture>

    The following images demonstrate the effect of alignment and
    justification on the layout of text:

    | | |
    | --- | --- |
    | ![align=left](align-left.png) | ![align=left, justify](align-left-justify.png) |
    | ![align=center](align-center.png) | ![align=center, justify](align-center-justify.png) |
    | ![align=right](align-right.png) | ![align=right, justify](align-right-justify.png) |


    It is possible, as well, to ignore the 2-D setup,
    and simply treat the results of a `PangoLayout` as a list of lines.
