    A `PangoGlyphItemIter` is an iterator over the clusters in a

    The *forward direction* of the iterator is the logical direction of text.
    That is, with increasing `start_index` and `start_char` values. If `glyph_item`
    is right-to-left (that is, if `glyph_item->item->analysis.level` is odd),
    then `start_glyph` decreases as the iterator moves forward.  Moreover,
    in right-to-left cases, `start_glyph` is greater than `end_glyph`.

    An iterator should be initialized using either
    `Pango.GlyphItemIter.init_start` or
    `Pango.GlyphItemIter.init_end`, for forward and backward iteration
    respectively, and walked over using any desired mixture of
    `Pango.GlyphItemIter.next_cluster` and
    `Pango.GlyphItemIter.prev_cluster`.

    A common idiom for doing a forward iteration over the clusters is:

    ```
    PangoGlyphItemIter cluster_iter;
    gboolean have_cluster;

    for (have_cluster = pango_glyph_item_iter_init_start (&cluster_iter,
                                                          glyph_item, text);

    Note that `text` is the start of the text for layout, which is then
    indexed by `glyph_item->item->offset` to get to the text of `glyph_item`.
    The `start_index` and `end_index` values can directly index into `text`. The
    `start_glyph`, `end_glyph`, `start_char`, and `end_char` values however are
    zero-based for the `glyph_item`.  For each cluster, the item pointed at by
    the start variables is included in the cluster while the one pointed at by
    end variables is not.

            Serializes a `PangoTabArray` to a string.

        In the resulting string, serialized tabs are separated by newlines or commas.

        Individual tabs are serialized to a string of the form

        POSITION is the position of the tab, optionally followed by the unit _px_.
        If ALIGNMENT is omitted, it defaults to _left_. If ALIGNMENT is _decimal_,
        the DECIMAL_POINT character may be specified as a Unicode codepoint.

        Note that all tabs in the array must use the same unit.
